										 <h2>Chapter Nineteen</h2>
    <h2>IS MY CHILD REALLY REBELLIOUS?</h2>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">Before you begin to run high your blood
      pressure unnecessarily, you need to be sure of the allegations you are
      pinning on your kid. It is not every time your teenage son or daughter
      does something which gets you annoyed that shows he or she is rebelling.
      Which of us did not at one time or the other step on our parents’ toes
      when we were growing up as young adults? It will be a grievous error to
      make the mistake of considering everything the child does wrong as
      rebellion or to assume every time he does not accept what you say
      unquestionably that he is rebelling. He is a free moral agent with his own
      will power too and not a robot.<br>
      <br>
      Calling rebellious a child who is not one can be very prophetic,
      especially if it is coming from the anointed tongue of a man of God like
      you. You need to be sure that what you call rebellion is actually
      rebellion and not just a mild protest to an unjust action or a normal
      display of youthful exuberance that will wear away with time, or else, you
      may end up sowing the seed of a rebellious attitude on a fertile ground
      that has none of it before, and this may be catastrophic. A good child
      needs to be appreciated for whatever he does right as well as corrected
      for what he does wrong, but should not be labeled what he is not simply
      because of a little error.<br>
      <br>
      You will not call the same teenager a failure in life simply because he
      has failed a midterm test. So why call a good boy rebel for simply
      reacting when his parents step on his toes. At times, our overreaction as
      parents to issues which are the norm of the day to every teenager, and on
      which the Bible is categorically silent, but which is against our cultural
      upbringing can make Pastors’ Kids feel unfortunate to be born into a
      pastor’s family, and this can incite a rebellious attitude against God in
      some of them.<br>
      <br>
      Whatever is not against the clear moral standard of the balanced gospel
      should not become a major source of crisis between a Preacher’s Kid and
      his preacher parents so as not to unconsciously begin to transform the
      heart of a nice Christian boy or a sweet Christian girl into a rebellious
      ground because of cultural or generational differences. A good example of
      this is compelling your seventeen year old teenage daughter to dress like
      her seventy year oldaged grandmother to her friend's sixteenth birthday
      party and expect her not to react. This, in a sense, cannot be called
      rebellion against God.<br>
      <br>
      It is one thing to safely conclude from your observations of their quirky
      behavior that your son is on the rebellion train, but it is another thing
      for God to fully agree with you. What you label rebellion may be your
      daughter’s open reactions to the old fashioned religious practices and the
      shortcomings of the particular brand of Christianity that you are
      marketing to her. Some of the things your generations learnt to do in the
      name of ‘sanctified living’ may be a far cry from the definition of
      holiness in this generation. God truly has not changed from whom He is
      when He introduced Himself to Abraham as the “I am that I am”, but men’s
      perception of him has been changing from generation to generation and this
      does not necessarily change His principles or tamper with His
      establishment.<br>
      <br>
      Just as God is not interested in whether your face cap is worn with the
      tip to the front in the last generation or to the back in this generation,
      or whether you read the Bible from a handwritten papyrus scroll like in
      Apostle Paul’s days, from printed papers as in your days, or from the
      screen of a mobile gadgets as in their days, most of what your generation
      have come to identify with godly living, as good as they may look, may
      cause constant friction between you and your son or daughter if not well
      handled. Just the same way Apostle Peter would have been surprised with
      the use of drum sets and pianos in our church services today, rather than
      tambourines and clapping that his generation was used to.<br>
      <br>

                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										<div style="text-align: justify;">
										 In order to reduce the number of frictions you have with your son or
      daughter, you may need to redefine your concept of holiness and godly
      living. Make a choice; either to be pleased with just seeing your son
      living a life pleasing to the Lord heartily and happily, or living a life
      pleasing to the human authorities over the church sadly and coldly, which
      could lead him out of the church into the world. A spiritually minded
      parent should prefer the former to the latter.<br>
      <br>
      Each time you place a dividing rule between God, your son, your church
      denomination, and the world, your son may not fall on the same side with
      your church denominations, but as long as he falls on the side of God, be
      assured that he is safe from the roaring lions in the world. One who is in
      step with the Lord will definitely be out of step with the world.<br>
    </div>
    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">TYPES OF REBELLIONS</h2>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">Pastor’s Kids rebellion can be viewed from
      two different angles, either active rebellion or passive rebellion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ACTIVE REBELLION</b><br>
      Those who rebel actively by being highly vocal in their decision to turn
      against the religious flow their parents had encouraged them to take are
      easily noticed because of the outward demonstration of their inner
      convictions. These are the ones that are quickly recognizable and often
      labeled as rebellious. A huge chunk of this book addresses this group of
      Preacher’s Kids<br>
      <br>
      <b>PASSIVE REBELLION</b><br>
      Worse still, there are some who remain obedient and who does all the
      things that are expected of them while growing up, but whose mind is in
      hot rebellion against what they practiced. Although, the respect they have
      for their parents, and the little fear of God that still remains in their
      hearts will not make them voice out their opinion, but one may be able to
      sense it in their lack of passion and commitment to the things of God.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of growing up to be strong Christian adults who will be on fire
      for the Lord, touching the lives of both their children and others
      positively for the kingdom, they grow upto be very passive and lukewarm
      believer, which is a sharp blend from what they were trained to be.<br>
      <br>
      Since Passive Rebellion is not aggressive, the symptoms are not easily
      noticeable to an average onlooker. It only comes in the form of spiritual
      indifference and passive Christianity, and only a very sensitive person
      can discern it.<br>
      <br>
      The quiet passive rebellion may seem preferable and acceptable because it
      is less volatile and unreactive compared to the active one, but it is not
      less destructive, as all rebellion leads the Preacher’s Kid away from the
      Lord if not rightly attended to maturely on time.<br></div>

    </div>
    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">SIGNS OF WAYWARDNESS &amp; WORLDLINESS</h2>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">Rebellion is like a tree; it does not grow
      the same day it is planted. It starts of by shooting its roots into the
      soil in order to have a firm grip and stability before growing upward on
      the surface of the soil. Rebellion, at the time it begins to appear on the
      surface in the life of any Christian kid, has already taken deep roots; so
      much has happened underneath.<br>
      <br>
      In tackling rebellion, one may need the spirit of God to know when it
      begins to develop its roots as this is the best period to attack it on
      time before it takes roots, but in case one is not sensitive enough, the
      next best time is when one begins to notice its growth on the surface.<br>
      <br>
      Rebellion has more to do with what is going on inside the person than what
      is happening outside. What has happened outside is only a reflection of
      what has transpired inside. Most parents take this trivial initial signs
      for granted, thinking it is still small and can be curtailed at any time,
      without knowing that the roots are already firm in the ground, and if
      allowed some more time, it will grow up to become a mighty tree which will
      take more effort to cut down. For every little sign of rebellion you
      notice in the life of your kid, there is a deep seated, intertwined,
      firmly gripped root under the surface. So do not postpone actions; address
      it immediately.<br>
      <br>
      In this part, we will consider some little signs of rebellion, waywardness
      or worldliness in a Preacher’s Kid.<br>
      One major sign of rebellion in the life of any Preacher’s Kid is that he
      begins to reject the value system he has been brought up with. This
      rejection is completely different from asking honest questions about his
      father’s faith in order to know more about what his preacher parents
      believes; it is actually a complete attack on those believes. He
      constantly projects strong arguments against biblical standards and
      becomes strongly antagonistic to the things of God.<br>
      <br>
      It is always as though a wicked virus had escaped into the memory card of
      his spiritual life, formatted all the spiritual programs in the hard drive
      that stores all the trainings he has been given before now, and
      reinstalled the latest version of a new application, World Affinity 3.0,
      which natural causes him to react against anything that has to do with
      Christ or his church.<br>
      <br>
      The things of the spirit naturally begin to annoy him. At the initial
      stage, he starts by complaining about his father’s over-commitment to
      church activities for no just cause until it advances to a great protest
      about spiritual things. He intentionally blocks God and related matters
      out of his lives. The spiritual passion with which he used to be known
      while growing up as a tender believer begins to dwindle.<br>
      <br>
      The hunger for spiritual things dies in him. He loses all the excitements
      he has about God and all the spiritual steam he has about the church. His
      spiritual temperature drops to room temperature, nothing exciting about
      it. Anything about Jesus is handled with a lackadaisical attitude. He used
      to be a dedicated worker in church before but now, the thingsof the spirit
      does not enthuse him. If at all he does anything in church again, he does
      it with reluctance, especially if he cannot avoid them.<br>
      <br>
      He becomes highly disinterested in spiritual advices. The words of God
      become extremely irritating to him. He turns deaf hears to advices from
      either his parents or any spiritual being. He will rather listen to a
      fellow lost kid share his experiences about the vanities in the world than
      listen to spiritually uplifting words of encouragement from a spiritual
      person. He intentionally refuses to listen to any instruction that takes
      its roots from the Bible. He feels following the precepts of the Bible has
      done enough harm to his parents, and he is not ready to sacrifice his
      young life on the same altar. He needs to enjoy life to the ultimate, and
      the Bible is too old fashioned to guide him to do this.<br>

										<div style="text-align: justify;">
										 Since he is detached from the Lord and does not feel uncomfortable about
      the church, he begins to miss church services at will without any genuine
      excuse. If he must give reasons before absconding from services, any
      thinkable reason at all, whether reasonable to the hearer or not, is
      presentable enough for him. Just anything to say to avoid being in God’s
      presence.<br>
      <br>
      In place of his former spirituality, he begins to embrace everything that
      is against what his family ever stands for. He has a very high criminal
      tendency, is involved in drugs, alcohol, and lives a promiscuous life. All
      of these and more becomes the substitute to its spiritual fervor. Everyone
      around begins to wonder what is wrong with him, or what has happened to
      him, or why a Pastor’s Kid should behave like he does, but he is never
      moved. He places more value on, and tends to associate more with the
      things of the world than the things of the Lord.<br>
      <br>
      He begins to see God as no big deal, Christ as just a religious leader,
      and refer to Jesus merely as a big Uncle; Bros Jay is his nickname for
      Him. He begins to take God for granted. He may not behave like an
      antichrist or an enemy of the Gospel, depending on how far he has gone
      into carnality, but he obviously turns his back on God and anything that
      has to do with him.<br>
      <br>
      He is always found to be challenging constituted authorities either in the
      church or in his school. He is likely going to be disrespectful, rude to
      elders, bad mannered and lawless. He refuses chastisements and
      corrections, either openly or privately.<br>

    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">PROTECTING THE PREACHER’S INTEGRITY</h2>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">All these are the foundations for
      rebelling against God. Once you notice one or a combination of any of
      these symptoms in your child’s life, it is time to address them
      immediately. Do not wait until the little mustard seed grow to become like
      a cedar tree before attending to it. These symptoms if addressed
      immediately can foster a more cordial relationship both between a
      Preacher’s Kid and his preacher parents and also between the Preacher’s
      Kids and his father in heaven.<br>
      <br>
      The challenge with most men of God is that they try to cover up things and
      wait until things get out of hand before they start looking for emergency
      solutions. They will rather put in more effort in rebranding their
      diminishing public image at the expense of the best interest of their son
      or daughter.<br>
      <br>
      Their preoccupation with image control has become a bigger challenge to
      them. They try selfishly to hide their challenges with their sons and
      daughters so as to protect their shivering ego. Even when the eventuality
      has happened, in their minds, they insist no child can afford to bring
      shame to the family, or mockery to their ministry, and they do all in
      their power to cover it up.<br>
      <br>
      A female Preacher’s Kid who gets mistakenly impregnated out of wedlock is
      bundled away from home in the middle of the night to a relative who stays
      far away from the church environment. This is done not primarily to give
      the young erring lady a better antenatal services and a renewal of her
      commitment to the Lord but to protect the image of thepreacher parent. A
      young boy who is discovered to be rude and unmannerly is sent to a
      boarding school or made to travel abroad before the members of the church
      discovers and starts complaining about his uncultured manners.<br>
      <br>
      All of these may indeed protect the pastor’s image temporarily, but it is
      like postponing the evil day. These Pastor’s Kids most times will always
      come back home worse than they left.</div>
