										<h2>Chapter Twenty Two</h2>
    <h2>RESTORING A WAYWARD PREACHER’S KID</h2>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">If you are a preacher parent who is
      frustrated about the result of your constant spiritual effort on your
      children and disappointed that they are not embracing the faith as much as
      you will desire, do not give up: there is hope for you. Whatever the level
      of waywardness you find in your son, or whatever the amount of worldliness
      you discover in your daughter, no matter the level of degradation they
      have gone through, irrespective of their ages, there is still hope for
      him. God can still cause a positive turnaround, if only we will be willing
      to do something about it. God will never give up on him, and as long as
      everyone around him does not give up on him, the future is still bright.<br>
      <br>
      Whenever a Preacher’s Kid turns his back on the Lord and it becomes so
      glaring that neither his preacher parents nor the church has any hold on
      him again, rather than the parents concentrate their efforts on what
      matters most, which is continuously praying for his soul at every
      opportunity on daily basis, due to their frustration and desperation, they
      channel the whole of their passion into doing the same ineffective things
      that brought the child to this stage of rebellion, most of which simply
      just enforces religious or doctrinal commitments, and really has little or
      nothing to do in having a deep relationship with the risen Lord.<br>
      <br>
      When a Preacher’s Kid rebel, sometimes, it is not because of what the
      parents did or do not do. It could, at times, be beyond the parents
      actions to other things. It often is because of a conclusion made from
      series of experiences over the years, which has now influenced his
      attitude, changed his orientation about life, and tampered with his
      mindset about Christianity and God in general.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM</b><br>
      In order to address the rebellion, most times we only overreact without
      first discovering what these experiences they have had were, and
      re-orientating them about these experiences so that they can now arrive at
      a better and saver conclusions. Only this, aided by prayers, will be able
      to change their mindset about Christ and Christianity.<br>
      <br>
      Every outward display of spiritual insubordination can be traceable to an
      inner struggle. It could be a struggle with sin, peer pressure or
      personality identity crisis. Whatever the struggle is, your first
      responsibility, in your bid to bring back your about-to-be-lost son is to
      discover it.<br>
      <br>
      Our concentration should be more on the cause and not on the resulting
      effect. It is always easier to control whatever is happening on the
      outside when you have first put the stormy rage of the enemy on their
      inside under control. Things only get worse when you try to fight the
      external expression of an internal challenge without first knowing what
      the internal problem is and addressing it.<br>
      <br>
      What most parents will do is react to the situation by rushing to reel out
      a set dos and don’ts so as to curb the young lad’s excesses. This has not
      always worked! It only has succeeded in causing the Pastors’ Kids to
      strengthen his mind to rebel the more. No movies again! No television!
      Memorize 2,000 scriptures daily! All of these are good but they become
      non-effective unless you know what the source of the rebellion is. You may
      still need to apply one or more of these after you discover why they do
      what they do but then it will be more strategic and targeted at the point,
      rather than just firing bullets aimlessly without any focus or goal.<br>
      Knowing what the source of the problem is will also help you to be more
      specific when praying for them.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ADMIT HIS PRESENT SPIRITUAL STATUS</b><br>
      This is another major mistake that preachers with rebellious kids always
      have. They tend to respond to their son’s behavior as though the child is
      still a believer. They never want to come to the realization that what
      they have to deal with is less of a believer who needs an advance lecture
      on how to be closer to God and more of an erring believer who has lost
      almost all the knowledge they have of God and His ways.<br>
      <br>
      Most of the things they expect the kids to do are things that the kid
      cannot connect reasonably with; pray more, read your Bible more, fast
      more, go to church more. All of these make no difference to a teen who is
      already gone with the world. In Apostle Paul's Word, “the message of the
      cross is foolishness to those who are perishing”. The earlier you admit
      the fact the better. Your child has tumbled away from the path of
      salvation, and is treading the path of peril and so your religious
      ceremonies and spiritual gymnastics, no matter the value they weigh to
      you, mean little or nothing to them. It is like expecting a tree to
      produce the fruits it is incapable of.<br>
      <br>
      Although, it is difficult to admit that, just because of a little
      rebellion, the Preacher’s Kid is now seen as an unbeliever, but seeing
      them in this light will help us become more patient in dealing with them
      and we will understand their struggle with spiritual things, not as being
      insubordination against God but as a lost soul that needs to be reached.
      This, in essence, will affect the way we minister to them, pray for them
      and even view some of theirsinful actions. Since God has called us to love
      sinners, this will help you to still love your rebellious son or daughter,
      rather than allow his actions to bring hatred between both of you and
      create bitterness in your heart.<br>
										</div>
										
										
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										<div style="text-align: justify;">
										This view about them will help us to give them a response of grace, rather
      than an outburst of anger or a constant theological lecture that enters
      through their right ears but flows out at the same moment through the left
      without achieving any purpose in their life.<br>
      <br>
      In reacting to their rebellious nature, so many preacher parents who finds
      themselves in this unpalatable situation end up fighting with their kids
      without even realizing what they are doing or understanding the gravity of
      the serious issues their children have with God. This lack of concern from
      the preacher parents to the Pastors’ Kids always infuriate the kid the
      more, causing them to rebel the more. At this point of their lives, what
      they need is our unconditional love expressed through grace and not rage.
      Our manner of expression of this unconditional love to a large extent will
      determine how they accept Christ’s sacrifice and unconditional love.<br>
      <br>
      <b>GET A COUNSELLOR</b><br>
      If you really admit they are in a pretty bad shape, then you will endeavor
      to get help from anyone who can help them before things get worse. There
      is no need covering up the issues within the family walls if no one within
      the walls can proffer the needed solutions.<br>
      <br>
      Most teens who have issues with their fathers faith always feel a lot more
      at home confiding in a neutral person than their biological parents. So,
      get them a counselor who they trust. This counselor could be their
      spiritual mentor, a Christian relative, their youth pastor or a respected
      elder in the community, but more often than not, not their parents.<br>
      <br>
      Before handing him over to the counselor, open up to the counselor on all
      you about him, who he used to be before, who he is now, and all the things
      he does now which makes you think he is threading the path of worldliness.
      These information will help the counselor to start off on a good note.<br>
      <br>
      <b>RAISE PRAYER WARRIORS FOR THEM</b><br>
      If a Preacher’s Kid has gotten to this level, the parents need to admit
      that, humanly speaking, there is little they can do; they are helpless and
      hopeless in the physical. Only parents who have not been there will
      contest this fact. Their hope is only in the ability of the sovereign Lord
      in whose hands the hearts of kings are as a gear rod, and he turns it
      whichever way he desires. Only Him can achieve impossible feats, as the
      Bible confirms that with Him, all things are possible. Depend solely on
      Him.<br>

										<div style="text-align: justify;">
										You may also need to raise prayer warriors for your children. One of the
      easiest things for pastors to do is to raise prayer warriors for the needs
      of members in the church. But very few pastors raise prayer warriors for
      their kids when they discover misbehaviors in their lives. All pastors
      believe in the power of prayers, and it should be a handy tool once they
      begin to notice some worldly challenges in the lives of the children, and
      not wait until the little seed of rebellion has grown into a mighty tree
      before attacking it. A stitch in time saves nine<br>
      <br>
      <b>RELAX ON DOCTRINAL ISSUES</b><br>
      You cannot afford to be defending doctrinal issues and denominational
      thesis when your child’s relationship with God is at the verge of
      collapse. Surprising enough, this is what most preacher parents do and
      this always pushes the child deeper into the pit of rebellion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>COME DOWN TO HIS LEVEL</b><br>
      It is highly frustrating when you have tried everything you know how to do
      in order to correct the young man who is hastily going off the daily
      rhythmic tune you have maintained over the years in your family, but none
      of all of your efforts seems to be yielding any tangible positive results.<br>
      <br>
										</div>
										
											
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="settings">
										<div style="text-align: justify;">
										The next thing to do is to descend low to whatever level he is and stop
      assuming he is still high up there spiritually. If you must pick him up,
      you must start from where he is and raise him back up. Maintaining a
      strong hold on your pride may not help in this matter. If you are really
      interested in getting your child back to the fold you will have to forget
      your ego and come down from your high exalted status. Humble yourself by
      coming to the level of your child. Come down to his level of reasoning so
      that you can help him get a better level of reasoning.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SHOW HIM LOVE</b><br>
      Do not allow bitterness in your heart against him because of his actions,
      you may end up hurting yourself more.<br>
      <br>
      It may not be very easy to show any iota of love to such a child at a time
      like this. However, rather than grow to hate your rebellious Pastor’s Kids
      each new day, as it is humanly expected of you, do something much more
      tasking; see him with the eyes of God’s grace filled with tender loving
      care. Whatever level of love you extend to him as his earthly parent at a
      time like this will help him believe more in your claims of the love his
      father in heaven is extending to him.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DEPEND ON THE HOLY SPIRIT’S GUIDANCE</b><br>
      As you pray for him on daily basis and trust God to intervene in the life
      of the erring child, do nothing out of the flesh. The battle is not a
      physical battle. It is more of a spiritual one, and nothing you do out of
      the flesh will yield the expected result. It will only add more pressure
      and aggravate things.<br>
      <br>
      Do not see it as a clash between a preacher father and a preacher’s Kid.
      See it more as a battle for the soul of a young man with a great future.
      All the devils in hell are interested in his soul as much as all the
      angels in heaven are. Whoever wins out of the host of heaven and
      the cohorts of hell will determine who gets the soul. It is
      very natural to assume that the angels of heaven are more powerful and
      will therefore will the demons of hell, but if you take laws into your
      hands and do not ask for specific directions on the issues, you may find
      out as, sad as it may sound, the host of hell will eventually take
      possession of his soul.<br>
      <br>
      This is why you need to full depend on God before taking actions. So many
      people will suggest many lofty ideas to you and all of them will sound
      reasonable, but not all reasonable ideas are applicable to all situation.
      Rather listen more to men, give more attention to God.<br>
      Once you begin to depend on God, he will lead you to take specific actions
      that will yield unquantifiable results in little time. The erring soul
      will begin to desire the love of Christ again, and sooner than later will
      be restored back to the fold, never to wander away again.
