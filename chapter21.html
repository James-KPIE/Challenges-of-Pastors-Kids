										<h2>Chapter Twenty One</h2>
    <h2>WHY PREACHER’S KIDS REBEL</h2>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">If you honestly feel you have tried your
      best in raising a godly child, but your grown up child has turned out to
      be the exact opposite of the baby you nursed, in order to help the child,
      you will need to understand reasons why Preacher’s Kids sometimes choose
      to go the way of evil. Until you are willing to evaluate the cause and
      effect of your kid’s rebellious spirit, you are not yet ready for change.<br>
      <br>
      Almost all of the challenges a Christian teenager faces can cause such to
      rebel if not well handled. Most of these challenges have been discussed in
      previous chapters. In addition to all of that, we will focus on some more
      vital ones in this chapter.<br>
      <b></b><br>
      <b>A TASTE OF THE WORLD</b><br>
      One of the reasons why some Preachers’ Kids turn their back on the moral
      training they receive at home is an inner inordinate desires for the
      pleasures of the world. Some of them just leave the church for want of a
      worldly experience. They just desire to have a feel of what the world
      looks like. “How can you tell people how chocolate tastes if you have not
      had a bite before”? They seem to ask.<br>
      <br>
      Just like the prodigal son, some of them will have to go out to have a
      bite of one or more of the items on the devil’s menu lists, before they
      realize it is not as yummy as it tastes. They have just been deceived with
      the ‘screen saver’; the real meal is not as palatable.<br>
      <br>
      All human beings have a certain innate desire to want to explore, to
      experience, to know, to understand, to feel, what they have not been
      exposed to previously. Some peoplehave the ability to control this desire,
      but not all can actually control the urge. This desire is at varying
      degrees, depending on each person’s ability to take risks. However, if you
      had actually trained them up in the way of the Lord, you can be sure they
      will soon realize their errors and will still return home before they are
      swallowed by the roaring lion waiting to devour them in the world.<br>
      <br>
      As it has been established before in previous chapters, it is not all
      Christian parents that can be blamed for their children’s excesses. The
      truth is, it is possible to have done all that you practically need to do
      as a godly parent in bringing them up in the way of the Lord, and they
      still choose to go their own part. This may cause your blood pressure to
      heighten in no time. But be rest assured that, they will soon come back to
      the Lord if you do not relent in praying for them, as long as they have
      actually been trained in the way of the Lord. Just as the good shepherd
      went in search of, and attended to the lost sheep that wandered away from
      the other 99, as told by our Lord in one of His parables, the good Lord,
      the Bishop and the shepherd of our soul, will ensure that he is back to
      the fold before the roaring lions devour him.<br>
      <br>
      Many Christian parents do not know how to handle this, when they see that
      one of their kids is showing this tendency to prefer worldliness to
      godliness. Rather than help the child, they take steps and actions that
      drives such child further away from Christ into the world. Beatings,
      badgering, insulting and denying them of rights and privileges will not do
      as much as correcting them in love.<br>
      <br>
      The mistake most of these parents make is to assume that the values and
      the principles they preach will automatically be carried over and start
      manifesting in their kids’ life. This is not always so.<br>
      <br>
      So many pastors always complain that they have trained up their children
      in the way he should go, but that the child grows up and departs from it
      until he is eternally lost. This is like taking God as a liar or saying
      the His words are ineffective. <i>“Train up a child in the way he should
        go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.”</i> Pro 22:6<br>
      <br>
      No one can claim a soul is eternally lost until it has taken its last
      breath. Do not give up on anyone when God has not given up on them; and
      God will not give up on them until they cross from this side of eternity
      to the other.<br>
      <br>
      A child that grows up being trained in the way he should go may once in a
      while veer off the way, but his wonderings will not lead to eternal death
      because of the solid foundation he has; he likely will soon find his own
      way back to the truth. Only the child that is indoctrinated with religion,
      without a solid relationship with Jesus, may likely get lost for life.<br>
      This is why no preacher parents should just assume that his children will
      naturally grow up to love the Lord. Teach them right from their childhood.
      A child is a child. He has a choice to either live for God or revolt
      against Him, regardless of his father’s position in the church. But if he
      is trained in the way he should go right from childhood, when he grows up,
      he will not depart from it, even if he mistakenly strolls away, he will
      still finds his way back.<br>

										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										<div style="text-align: justify;">
										 It is normal as a pastor to feel frustrated and embarrassed when your
      child does not follow your ways, but you can console yourself with the
      fact that you have indeed done the things you are supposed to do, which is
      laying the proper foundation. Imagine the frustration Jesus would have
      felt when he noticed the unbelief and the conduct of the people in his
      days, after showing them all of the signs and wonders; especially in his
      own place of birth of all places. But even Jesus knows that when a man has
      made his choice, aside divine intervention which is spurred by the prayer
      of the people who have genuine concerned for the person, and their
      constant reasonable counsel, not much can be done about it.<br>
      <br>
      No father, no matter how spiritual he is, and how much love he has for the
      child, has any power to make his child become a Christian; that is God’s
      sole prerogative. What is important is to have built a solid spiritual
      foundation of a relationship with God for them, for the Bible says,<i> “if
        the foundation be destroyed, what shall the righteous do”</i>? If indeed
      you have, you can confidently rest yourself in the assurance that you have
      laid the right foundation for the child and believe that wherever they go,
      the strong foundation you have designed will keep them grounded in the
      faith.<br>
      <br>
      If you have actually planted the right seed of a relationship with God in
      your child, you can be sure that your prodigal son will always come back
      home. There is nothing in this world that is strong enough to keep in its
      system a man who has the right foundation of God’s word. The world has
      nothing to offer a spiritually minded person. It may only be a matter of
      time he will soon come looking for Jesus. The yearning for God will always
      come back, and the only place he can find rest is with the savior of his
      soul.<br>
      <br>
      <b>RAISED IN A WORLDLY CHURCH</b><br>
      Another reason for waywardness in a Preacher’s Kid is when there is not
      too much difference between the father’s church and what is obtainable in
      the world.<br>
      <br>
      In order to win the sinners outside the church into the fold, some pastors
      have made their church so sinner friendly that worldliness is no longer
      strange in such churches. Their churches have been designed in such a way
      that there is little or no difference between the church of the Lord and
      the immediate environment it finds itself in the world. Therefore, it is
      becoming increasingly difficult for their sons and daughters to trace any
      meaningful contrast between the two. Such pastors have with their own
      hands, driven their wards into the world.<br>
      <br>
      In this type of churches, the line between godliness and worldliness is so
      thin that one can easily cross onto either side of the touchline without
      consciously being aware that one has gone too far into the world while
      still claiming to be in the church. There is so much patronage of, and
      over-exposure to unreasonable measures of unbiblical doctrines and unsafe
      doses of unscriptural activities. This makes the children more of
      motivational super stars or hip-hop celebrities, than a child of the
      minister of the gospel.<br>
      <br>
      This type of gospel is what has kept so many Pastors’ Kids struggling with
      the salvation experience in the name of the Lord Jesus whom their parents
      constantly claim to represent before the people. The gospel their parents
      preach has encouraged them to sacrifice godliness and contentment for an
      opportunity to look more like the world on daily basis, and the more of
      the world they resemble, the less of Christ they manifest.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EMBRACING A STRANGE GOSPEL</b><br>
      Another reason is believing in a strange gospel. One of which is, once
      saved always saved. The proponent of this particular gospel message
      believes that once you are saved, your names get written in the book of
      life, and nothing whatsoever you do again in life can delete your names
      from the Golden Book. It is called the theory of eternal salvation.<br>
      <br>
      A myopic and unbalanced gospel as this can give the Pastor’s Kid the
      liberty to want to intentionally decide to begin to explore the world of
      sin, since it has no negative effect either directly on him, or indirectly
      on his eternal pursuit.<br>
      <br>
      <b>RELIGION FORCED DOWN THEIR THROAT</b><br>
      Another major reason why Preacher’s Kids refused to follow their fathers’
      faith is when religion, and not Christ, is forced down their throat. The
      imposition of a physical activity based on unbalanced scripture in the
      name of religion can drive any Preacher’s Kid either away from his father
      church to another or completely from his faith to another.<br>
      <br>

                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="messages">
										<div style="text-align: justify;">
										Teenagers and youths are always looking for something real and authentic.
      If they cannot see that in whatever you offer them, they may get easily
      drawn to other options that seems to them more genuine. Whatever that is,
      it is not going to be something that willgladden your heart. It may be, on
      the average, a slight modification, or worse still, a complete deviation
      from what you have always offered them.<br>
      <br>
      This is because religions generally, Christianity inclusive, always
      permeates every aspect of a family, most especially when the parents are
      really religious. The child is raised in a very religious environment and
      is brainwashed to believe he is as religious as his parents simply because
      he does just about everything they do too. He attends Sunday school, Bible
      study, weekly prayer meetings, worship services, revival meetings, with
      constant fasting and other spiritual responsibilities so much so that even
      the child will never doubt that he is a Christian.<br>
      <br>
      Frankly, the fact that a kid does all these is not what makes him a
      Christian. We do not become Christians by the religious activities we
      engage in but by Whom we confess we belong to, and how much of our daily
      actions pleases Him. Most of these spiritual activities can be done
      without a deep rooted relationship with Christ or a connection to the real
      substance of their parent’s beliefs. These religious actions will only
      make a Preacher’s Kid a better Christian if he has first accepted Christ
      into his life.<br>
      <br>
      This is what is lacking in the lives of so many teenagers and youths who
      are raised by godly parents. They have learnt to do all the right things
      before they grow up to the age where they can decide to have a
      relationship with the right person who makes it easy for the flesh to
      overcome the Adamic nature and makes it convenient to continually do the
      right things by His grace, the man Jesus. This is a case of putting the
      cart before the horse.<br>
      <br>
      All things being equal, one would have thought that learning to do the
      right things should help them to decide for the Lord much faster in their
      lives, but as long as the devil is interested in these kids so as to
      discredit Christianity and drag them to his kingdom as useful instruments
      to depopulate the kingdom of God, all things can never be equal. This is
      why, although still very surprising, it is possible to teach all of your
      kids all the right things while growing up, but one of them still chooses
      not to embrace it when they get older. Their passion drifts, reflecting
      waywardness as other things becomes their priorities.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of forcing religion on them, let them grow to like it naturally.
      Being legalistic and religious will not get you the best result. Rather
      loving rational convictions will work the magic.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DEVIL’S RETALIATION</b><br>
      This may likely be the most important reason why Preacher’s Kids become
      wayward. So many Preachers have in times past, and are presently dealing
      deadly blows on the kingdom of hell. They are already recognize in the
      Satanic world has terrors whose activities always cause untold destruction
      to the works of the devil and his cohorts.<br>
      <br>
      This seems to be a good news to such ministers. However, with such a track
      record, he has opened himself and his immediate family up to attacks from
      hell. The devil will not fold his hands watching him destroy his kingdom
      without retaliating; and when he fights, he fights bad. He will hit back
      with all of his strength.<br>
      <br>
      Another good news is that, most times when the devil hits back, such
      minister who knows the level of havoc he has wrecked the dark world is
      always prepared for it, guarding himself with all spiritual weaponry
      needed to both defend himself and attack the opposition if need be. <br>
      However, if the devil decides to change his target and aim at the
      Preacher’s Kids, he is always surprised to find their spiritual coverage
      easily penetrable. This may be either because the father has not groomed
      them well enough, or that although they are well grown, they have been
      dipping their hands in untold sins which are unknown to their father.<br>

    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">A WORD OF CAUTION FOR THE PK</h2>
    <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Reproach to God</b><br>
      If your rebellious reaction today is to inflict some pains on your parents
      for whatever ills you feel they have done for you, you need to know that
      you are not just breaking the heart of your parents alone, you are also
      breaking the heart of God. Aside the shame you will bring to your parents,
      you also will bring insults to the name of the Lord. When a preacher’s Kid
      rebels, it brings a whole lot of insults and reproaches to the name of
      God. Men will say all manner of things to the God of your father simply
      because of your actions. Expatiate this! All manner of people will use his
      action as an opportunity to say unworthy things against the church simply
      because of one soul. Whatever the level of the storm of rebellion that is
      raging in your hearts today, you can allow the peace of God that passes
      all understanding calm your mind and bring peace to your soul.<br>

										<b>Disrespect and insult to their father’s ministry</b><br>
      Beyond the insult it will bring to God himself, it will also discredit his
      earthly father’s ministry. This has been dealt with at various places in
      the book. Your rebellion in a way puts your parents in a bad light in the
      public, especially before the members of the church who they claim to
      pastor. It gives them a bad reputation! Your behavior as a Preacher’s Kid
      becomes the report card of how effective your parents are at pastoring.
      Their success as a minister is judged on how well they have been able to
      govern their homes. How else will you explain it, that the one whose
      primary responsibility is to lead others to Christ cannot even
      successfully lead members of his family to Christ? This could be highly
      embarrassing.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Heartaches &amp; headaches for parents</b><br>
      Your unbalanced lifestyle can also cause your parents a lot of
      distractions from their official responsibilities. The time that should be
      used in planning the growth of the church and the welfare of their members
      would be diverted into running helter-skelter for your sake, organizing
      counseling sessions for you, or pleading to people whose items or
      integrity you have damaged because of your lifestyle, or organizing prayer
      sessions for you. They may need to start shopping for a new school for
      you, or looking for loans to pay for your medical bills or rehabilitation
      centers.<br>
      <br>
      All of these will take their full concentration away from their primary
      responsibilities in church, and cause them to be absent minded, even if
      they force themselves to be physically present at their duty posts. You
      may not know what your unscriptural lifestyle will cause your parents, but
      you do not want to imagine it, more so, you do not want your children too
      to cause you to go through such in your later years in life.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Untimely death for parents</b><br>
      Constant thoughts about your life can also give your parents some terminal
      diseases. They may develop high blood pressure which can eventually take
      their life, at which point you will be guilty of their blood. By heavens
      record, you will be seen as a murderer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Incur God’s wrath on themselves</b><br>
      You will also incur God’s wrath on yourself, not just for being
      rebellious, but for the consequences of your rebellion. Do not forget,
      your rebellion has tarnished image of God and brought reproaches to his
      name, a name which he jealously protects, and it has also destroyed the
      integrity of your parents in ministry, among other things. Such things
      will not go unpunished.<br>
      <br>
      That will not be all, you need to know that even if you decide to turn a
      leaf in the future, the bad image you have painted for your parents will
      not be forgotten in a hurry. Church members have a very sharp memory and
      are likely to always remember the pastor’s son who lost his manners and
      slept with a sister in the choir, or the pastor’s daughter who got
      impregnated by a brother in the welfare department in the church. You may
      sincerely repent, and God will even forgive you and forget about your sins
      as he has promised in his word, but men will seldom ever forget your past
      actions, and your parents will always carry the emotional scar, long after
      the wound has healed.
