										<h2>Chapter Twenty</h2>
    <h2>MINE IS WAYWARD, AND I KNOW IT</h2>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">If your child is not showing any of the
      signs highlighted in the last chapter, then his actions which you term as
      rebellious is not likely what you call it. They may just be ordinary
      complaints of an aggrieved mind. However, if after a careful check, you
      still insist that your child is showing signs of rebellion, then you need
      to do a checkup on what the source of the problem is.<br>
      <br>
      Before you go too far with this checkup, start with yourself! One is
      always quick to think the problem is with the other person whenever there
      is an issue; it may not always be true.<br>
      <br>
      When a Preacher’s Kid decides to act against the family faith and moral
      value, the first question the preacher parents need to ask themselves is
      “in what way have we contributed to our child's attitude against the
      faith”. Rather than make excuses and blame others, we must be willing to
      search our hearts and determine the roles we have played as parents in the
      gruesome choices our children have made.<br>
      <br>
      You may not always have to be blamed, but you need to be sure that you are
      not indeed to be blamed by genuinely answering honestly to this question,
      “What is my part in this?”<br>
      <br>
      This same question can be asked in so many other ways for clarity purpose.
      For example, you may want to ask yourself the following <br>
      questions which are generated from this singular question:<br>
      * What cogent part have I played in this predicament?<br>
      * What roles have I assumed that pushed him to the edge?<br>
      * What could I have done that I did not do?<br>
      * What should I not have done that I did?<br>
      * What words were left unsaid that I should have spoken?<br>
      * What should I not have said that I have built a monument around?<br>
      * What choices have I made in the past that has brought these negative
      consequences on my child?<br>
      * What actions of mine, my spouse or his immediate environment has led to
      these negative reactions from our child?<br>
      * What lifestyle of mine has influenced or encouraged this unfathomable
      choice of lifestyle of my child?<br>
      * Have I imposed too much parental restrictions or tolerated too few
      boundaries?<br>
      * Is my style of Christianity helping my child to follow the Lord or
      hurting him and pushing him away from the Lord?<br>
      * What particular aspect of the Christian Parenting Models that I have
      adopted is inciting my child to rebel against Christ?<br>
      * Have I been measuring my children’s spiritual progress by God's standard
      or by the opinion of others?<br>
      * In all of my actions and reactions with them, am I being led by the Holy
      Spirit or I am just defending traditions?<br>
      * Am I helping them to have an authentic relationship with God or just
      forcing them to be in the good records of my church authority?<br>
      * Are the spiritual principles I often emphasize at the family front the
      things that make my teens better Christians or things that make them good
      members of the church denomination I identify with?<br>
      * Am I unreasonably holding unto the doctrines of the traditional church
      while closing my eyes on the technological and generational changes that
      is sweeping over the world like a whirlwind or I am just simply honestly
      defending the old time religion which Christ shed his blood for?<br>
      * Is this really a fight between the good and the bad or the old and the
      new?<br>
      * Have I been able to differentiate between what is good and what is bad
      about the old, compared to what is good and what is bad about the new or I
      just simply assume that everything about the old is good and everything
      about the new is bad irrespective of what my children feels about both?<br>
      * What is fuelling the constant clashes between my son’s attitude and my
      spiritual expectations of him?<br>
      * What is the source of the unreasonable dispute between him and God? This
      is where the process of restoration always starts from.<br>
      * What kind of faith am I transferring to my children? Is it the kind of
      faith they want to willingly embrace or one they just want to reluctantly
      hold unto, pending the duration of their stay with me?<br>
      * Am I balanced in my biblical analysis to them and my spiritual
      expectations from them, or I am driven to one extreme or the other by what
      I think are the right things to be done?<br>
      * The things I have done to salvage this situation, have they made any
      positive impact or they have made the matters worse than it initially was?<br>
      * Do my children see genuine passion in my activities for the Lord or what
      they see is just religious commitment to a set of church creeds and tenets
      of faith?<br>
      * Is my son blindly revolting against the ordinances of the church or he
      is just yearning for spiritual biblical authentication of these
      activities?<br>
      * Am I putting tensions on them to demonstrate and exhibit the outward
      appearance of a believer rather than the regeneration of the inward man?<br>
      * Am I more particular about their Christian outlook to the detriment of
      their passion for Christ?<br>
      * Are my activities widening the gap between my child and my faith?<br>
      * Am I raising my kids to harbor a spirit of criticism and become
      judgmental of other Christian denominations which differ from mine, even
      if he has them as close friends?<br>
      * Will I rather prefer that their spiritual activities replace a close
      walk with God? Which of the two will in reality play a significant role in
      their maturity as a believer?<br>
      <br>
      If you find yourself guilty as a parent own up. Take responsibility for
      the things you caused and do not trivialize the issues. The things you
      need to do are discussed in Chapter 22<br>

										 <h2 style="text-align: justify;">TYPES OF REBELLIOUS PASTOR’S KIDS</h2>
    <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>1. THE SHORT TERM
        REBELLIOUS KID</b><br>
      There are different levels of waywardness when it comes to Pastor’s Kids
      generally. The first level comprises of those who, like the apostle Peter
      who betrayed Jesus, are on a very brief rebellious trip from the church.
      For no just cause, at least none that their parents or any member of the
      church can think of, they just wander away from the love of Christ. But
      they are always quick to return to the Lord. With the depth of God's word
      and the knowledge of God in their lives, there is nothing the devil wants
      to use that is strong enough to deceive these ones and keep them in his
      fold longer than necessary. They are always quick to discover the deceits
      of the devil. They cannot stay out of the church for too long before they
      begin to yearn for the manifestation of God's presence which comes only
      through his love. This presence, which always permeates the home where
      they once left, is something that the devil cannot replicate. Their brief
      trip into the world always terminate abruptly as they always end up
      returning to the Lord with a sober reflections and a repentant heart. Most
      times, they come back to become a stronger believer than they were
      initially.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. THE CONSISTENTLY REBELLIOUS KID</b><br>
      The second level of rebellious Pastors’ Kids are those with a consistent
      attitude of constantly visiting the world and returning to the church
      after a while. Unlike the first group whose rebellious excursion is a
      one-time experience, theirs is seasonal. One day he is in the church, the
      next day he is in the world. Today he is a believer, but tomorrow he is
      dining with the devil. He is constantly out of the church to have a taste
      of the world, but for each time he goes out of the ecclesiastical fold, he
      always returns back once he has had his fill of the world. His major
      challenge is that the source of his problem has not yet been addressed;
      the root of worldliness in his life has not been uprooted. Each time he is
      back to the fold, the preacher parent advices, counsels, and admonishes
      him. They try to check his life for any branch that has a resemblance with
      the world, and are always quick to cut such away once noticed. But it is
      only a matter of time, this branch buds again, and an uncontrollable
      desire to have a taste of what the world has to offer overcomes him one
      more time. Before the absentee preacher parent notices any change in him,
      or if at all they notice, before they take any meaningful step about it,
      he is long gone again, only to reappear not too long after in the same
      church again, with a repentant heart and a sober reflections. Until the
      source of worldliness in his life is dealt with, the cycle will
      continually repeats itself.<br></div>

                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="messages">
										<div style="text-align: justify;">
										<b>3. LOST BUT FOUND REBELLIOUS PREACHER’S KID</b><br>
      The third level of rebellious Pastor’s Kids are those who, like the
      prodigal son who left his father and journeyed into a far country, finds
      it very convenient to go on a long term excursion into the world. Unlike
      the first group who goes on a brief rebellious trip and the second group
      who enjoy several brief trips to the world, with either long or short
      breaks in between, these ones really gets carried away with the devil's
      adulterated version of enjoyment for a long time. The lust of the eyes,
      lust of the flesh, and the pride of life gets them so entangled with the
      world that they find it quite difficult to break its hold over their
      lives. Since most of them do not have sound scriptural foundation, they do
      not have enough spiritual strength to easily turn their back on the devil.
      Although this excursion into the world always takes a long time, the good
      news is that they always trace their way back home to the savior either
      while their parents are alive, or after they have gone to be with Lord.
      Theperiod of this long excursion is relative; for some it may be a few
      years while for some others, it is in multiples of it, long enough for
      their family and the church to completely lose hope of their coming back
      to the knowledge of the saving grace in the Lord Jesus, but no matter how
      long, they always find their way back to the place of the cross before it
      is too late, even if it is at their last minute with their last breadth on
      their death bed. Their earthly parent may not be there to rejoice with
      them on this decision, but there is joy in heaven, with their heavenly
      father, over this single sinner that repents.<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. THE ETERNALLY LOST PREACHER’S KID</b><br>
      The fourth group is the most pathetic group. Although they have everything
      similar to the last group who goes on a long vacation from the church in
      order to have a taste of what the world has to offer, they get so used to
      the taste of what the world offers that they completely lose the taste of
      what the Lord once offered them and is willing to offer them again. Their
      long vacation out of church into the world becomes an unending trip into
      the bottomless pit, a place of no return. Some of them may die prematurely
      because of their wayward lifestyle, and they end up without having an
      opportunity to come to the knowledge of the saving grace in the name of
      the Lord Jesus. They are lost forever. Some who grow to old age gets so
      used to the devil and what the world has to offer that they no longer
      appreciate what they lose by turning their backs on their savior. They
      also die without an opportunity to rededicate their lives to God again.
      They are not only lost from the church, but they are lost forever from the
      assembly of the saints, both here on earth, and thereafter in heaven, at
      the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.<br>
      <b></b><br>
      <b>I AM SURE I TRIED MY BEST</b><br>
      Whenever Christian kids rebel, it is not always because either of the
      parents have failed in their respective responsibilities to bring him up
      in the ways of the Lord. Of a truth, parental failure may be one of the
      major reasons why Pastors’ Kids rebel, but rebellious attitudes among
      Christian kids is not only limited to parental failure.<br>
      <br>
      There are some nice Christian families with sound moral upbringing who
      have had at least one of their kids rebel against their fathers’ religion
      at some points in their lives, and they tried to do everything they could
      about it, all to no avail. If you find yourself in this group, and you are
      so sure that you have done all that is humanly possible as expected by
      heaven in bringing the child in question up in the ways of the Lord, then
      you should have no condemnation in your hearts. It is natural to feel so
      bothered and concerned about the issue, but truthfully, either here on
      earth, or at the close of age in eternity, you are not to be blamed for
      whatever choice your child decides to make, if you have indeed done your
      part.<br>
      <br>
      All that God expects of every Christian parent, preacher or not, is to
      show our adolescents the way, and make it easy for them to follow the path
      by giving them all the necessary encouragements, physical or spiritual.
      Whatever decision they make thereafter, they face the consequence squarely
      solely. It always gladdens our hearts as either Christian parents or
      preacher parents to see them take the right decision, but when they take
      the wrong decisions, there is really little we can do about it, aside
      praying for their salvation before it is too late.<br>
      <br>
      Irrespective of what your church council or any other committee thinks
      about your parental ability, if you have genuinely searched yourself and
      feel you have tried your best for this kid, do not let whatever anyone
      says get at you. It is okay to be concerned about it but do not get overly
      worried such that it begins to affect either your health or the ministry
      God has committed to your hands. It is natural to feel concerned for a
      wayward child, but it is not helpful to feel very guilty for the crazy
      choices he has made, so much that it begins to affect you. If you are sure
      you have done all you should, contrary to what the devil will minister toyou,
      you are not a first class failure as a mum or dad; you may just be unlucky
      as a minister to have a kid who has chosen for now to go the other way.
      That is if indeed you have done your part.<br>

										The story of the prodigal son in the Bible is a good evidence to show that
      godly parents can do all the good things they know to do and it still may
      not stop a rebellious child from being a rebel. The father of the prodigal
      son did all a father could do to such extent that the story teller, Jesus,
      never found a fault with his parenting techniques, but his son still
      became recognized in the history of the Bible as the only prodigal son.<br>
      <br>
      Be careful to note that the father was not labeled the reckless or
      careless dad but the son was called the prodigal son. No parents pray for
      such, but it does happen. The prodigal son just rose up one day and
      decided that he has had enough of his father’s protections, the security
      around the home, the spirituality of the environment, the do’s and don’ts,
      and worse still, the enjoyment at the home front and the comfort of being
      around his nuclear family. All of these for no just cause, at least, none
      traceable to the father or mother. Some kids are still like this today,
      and their parents may not be responsible for their actions. It is just
      their choice to try out the self-destructive way.<br>
      <br>
      Do not feel too bad when you discover your properly raised Christian Kid
      is becoming rebellious with all of your spiritual investments upon him.
      See it in this light: Of all the Pastors’ Kids in the world, God has
      assigned you the responsibility of this rebellious one because he knows
      you have what it takes to maturely tame his excesses and bring him back to
      the Lord. Should you not be excited to be part of Heaven’s Special Task
      Force to bring solutions to a lost soul?<br>
      <br>
      So do not get yourself overwhelmed with guilt and misery. A number of
      suggestions will be given to you by other preacher friends or Christian
      parents, most of whom have been lucky with child rearing and have not had
      any of their child rebel before. Some of the suggestions they will give
      will sound nice while some others may make you look as though you are a
      baby in the Lord who do not understand Christian parenting; do not let it
      get at you. They really do not mean to hurt you. They are just trying to
      show their concern. They may ask you to keep punishing the kid at home
      until he bends to your will, or ask you to change his school or close
      friends. Some may even allege that it is because you do not read enough
      Bible verses at home during your morning devotions, or you do not sit
      together as a family during worship services, or the kid does not memorize
      enough scriptural verses on daily basis.<br>
      <br>
      All of these things have their advantages in bringing up a god fearing
      Preacher’s Kid and the absence of any could lead to raising a rebellious
      Preacher’s Kid, but the presence of all does not guarantee that a
      Preacher’s Kid will not misbehave once in a while. You may want to try out
      some of the reasonable advises you get around this time. But do not become
      too hard on the child, especially if he is old enough to determine to
      leave home and walk into the streets to make a living for himself. It is
      still better to have him under your roof and be trusting God for a change
      in his life, than to lose him into the waiting hands of agents of the
      devil on the streets where you have no idea what else they are introducing
      to him on daily basis<br>
      .<br>
      Keep your calm in the physical, but make serious effort in the spiritual.
      Control your emotions whenever you are around him, but wage serious war in
      the spirit every time he is not close by. If you continue in this and do
      not faint, as time goes on, God will give you the secret keys that will
      unlocks the hardened part of his heart, and he will come to identify God
      as his Lord and Savior.
