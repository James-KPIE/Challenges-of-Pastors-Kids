										<h2>Preface</h2>
											<p align="justify">Are you a P.K, or the parent of one? It’s nice to have you share my experiences about the challenges of P.Ks and how to overcome them. The Preacher’s Kid (P.K as it is generally called) is a term usually used to describe either the son or the daughter of a minister of the gospel, irrespective of his or her age. Even when some of them are already adults, they are still referred to as kids, and you will soon know why!</p>
											<p align="justify">Parents, who are deeply involved in the work of the ministry either as pastors, preachers, evangelists, deacons, elders, vicars, priests or bishops, always have their offspring automatically referred to as Preacher’s Kids. Whether the children like the identity or not does not make any difference, at least to those who prefer to call them as such. As long as your parents have something to do with the office of the clergy, you cannot escape either the designation or the challenges of a PREACHER’S KID.</p>
											<p align="justify">The essence of this book is obvious from its title. The Pastor's family today is the major battle ground of the archenemy of God, and the main target of that battle, just like the King on a Chess Board game, is the Preacher’s Kid. Once we allow the devil to capture them, the game may be over for the family.</p>
											<p align="justify">This book is an attempt to help the Preacher’s Kid realize the challenges ahead, get prepared for them before it is too late, and also help their preacher parents so that they can help their kids in a more spiritually conducive way that will encourage the Pastors’ kids to overcome whatever challenges they face and still stand tall for the Lord. Each chapter starts with a vivid description of what the challenge is, and ends with possible solutions that will either completely eliminate the challenge, or reduce its effect on the P.K.</p>
											<p align="justify">Most pastors spend years at the Bible School, Seminaries and Theological Colleges just to learn among other things, how they are expected to behave as pastors. However, they have children who for once have not been to any Preacher’s Kids’ School where they are taught how to be a good preacher’s child. But people still expect them to be at their best everyday anyway, whether they have been trained for it or not. This sound as though we are expecting to reap where we do not sow.</p>
											<p align="justify">Sad enough to say, either offline or online, there are very few intensive counseling resources for the preacher’s child to take advantage of, even at this age of massive information. They are left to take decisions on what is expected of them by their intuition and whatever else they gather by hearsay from the people around them. This, of course, is the reason why, once in a while, you find them falling into errors ignorantly.</p>
											<p align="justify">If you are a Preacher’s Kid, and you have been hurt before now, either by the church or whoever, I hope this book will help heal your wounds, open your eyes to what precisely is expected of you, help you to understand why your preacher parents react to you the way they do, and lastly help you to smoothen the stale relationship between you and other difficult members of your father’s church.</p>
											<p align="justify">If you are the parent of a Preacher’s Kid, or a church member, I pray that as you read the book, the Lord will open your eyes to what the Pastor’s Kids around you are going through, and open your understanding to ways you can help them become better Pastor’s Kids.</p>
											<p align="justify">If you have a Preacher’s Kid around you, or you are a close friend to the parent of one, and you really love them, get them a copy of this book. It will change their lives for better for live, teaching them both how to overcome the CHALLENGES OF BEING A PREACHER’S KID.</p>

											<h2>Foreword 1</h2>
											<p align="justify">The book, written by Sam O. Salau is an unusual one. I got to know him through a younger friend of mine, Rotimi Fadipe, an Executive Director with the Honeywell Flourmills Plc in Nigeria. He is one person for whom I have an extraordinarily great respect. He is honesty personified. That is just his description. He introduced Sam O Salau to me.</p>
											<p align="justify">When the request to write the foreword to this book was made, I could never say no, to this unusual privilege. I later got to know that Sam had before this one, written several other books.</p>
											<p align="justify">This book is written in the didactic style of a medical doctor, who does the prognosis of issues in the life of a Pastor or Preacher's Kid and prescribes attendant solutions, or would I say, reliefs. I am not sure Sam is a Pastor's Kid, but whether he is or not, he knows the Pastor's Kid.
											<p align="justify">We are introduced to the unique life of the Pastor's Kid, which is intertwined with the life of his or her parents. A call on the Father or Mother is also seen as a call on him or her. The expectation of the world, on the parents, is also their expectation on the Pastor's Kid, (hereinafter referred to as P. K), the age difference notwithstanding. This unwittingly puts a lot of pressure on the young P. K. This expectation has given rise to diverse types of P. Ks. Some had as a result become Lukewarm P. Ks, Worldly P. Ks, Lost P. Ks and the Ideal P. Ks, amongst others, as he rightly observed. What they became or would become, would emanate from their respective ability to handle these pressure points. To each of these character types, Sam, proffered mitigating prescriptions for handling the issues of life.</p>
											<p align="justify">The chapters described the Unrealistic Expectations on the Pastor's Kid by the world, the Sacrifices they make, their Low Key social life, their Individual Personal Challenges, the Unstable life they are forced to live as a result of the regular transfers of their parents, the Negative Reports from church politics as it affects their parents (and they too, ultimately). The chapters continue with the Parenting they receive, which in most cases is too little as a result of the work load of their parents, the P. K's love life, the dangers they face from the affective wrong friends, and so on.</p>
											<p align="justify">The strength of this book is in the fact that each chapter could stand alone as a book. It is such an unusual book in that each chapter starts with each challenge and then goes on to proffer solutions as to how the P. K could handle it. It goes beyond this, to suggest to the parents as to how to help the Kids handle the issues. It is such a total book.</p>
											<p align="justify">It is an exposition of the life of a Pastor's Kid, by one who is one or by someone especially gifted to be able to enter into their world. I was most touched by the chapter that shows how miserable P.Ks are when they get to new postings of their parents. While the Pastor and his wife are received with pomp and pageantry, the kids are lost in the crowd. Before they could make new friends, their parents are on the march again. The book gives very down to earth and sincere suggestions to the P.Ks on how to handle such situations. It goes further to teach the practical lessons to parents on how to assist their wards at such times.</p>
											<p align="justify">There is no chapter that is out of place, the flow of the prose is flawless from the beginning to the end. It is a book that each Preacher or Pastor should have and of course, to the Pastor's Kid, it is a new gospel on how to handle the challenges thrown at them, by the reason of the special assignment of their parents in this world. All church leaders should have it as reference material on church relationship within the topmost hierarchy of the church.</p>
											<p align="justify">I sincerely hope that Sam would follow up this with the challenges of the Pastors and the Pastor's Wife, they would make beautiful and instructive reading. Welcome to the world of the Preacher's Kids.</p>

											<h2>Foreword 2</h2>
											<p align="justify">To be very candid, I was very blessed by reading through the manuscript of this most important book for preachers’ family. There is not much book on this very crucial subject and the author has done a very great work by writing practically on the challenges of being a Preacher’s Kid. I wish I had seen this kind of book when my three boys were little. Am sure I could have done a better job of raising them in a more godly way.</p>
											<p align="justify">In the last two decades and half that the Lord has put me in the ministry of sharing, coaching, nurturing and relating with pastors and church leaders of every church affiliation, I have seen first hand the issues addressed eloquently in this book.</p>
											<p align="justify">Most Preachers Kids are under tremendous pressure to perform and behave, while the parenting skills of preachers have been called into questions over and over again. But I believe that the good Lord has inspired the author to write very well and this book is a timely solution to these onerous challenges.</p>
											<p align="justify">My intense desire is to see this book in the hand of every Pastor’s kid, especially preachers themselves.</p>
											<p align="justify">It is of utmost importance that every preacher should get a copy, read it well, mark it, masticate it and come back to it repeatedly to glean needed wisdom and advice. It sure will do you well to raise godly Preacher’s Kids.</p>

										<h2>Comments</h2>
										<p align="justify">The Challenges of Preacher’s Kid or as it is sweetly coined in the book ‘PK’ is a book that has brought to bear the many challenges faced in the dual roles of a Preacher and their children, giving the huge expectations placed on a Preacher’s kid, and some of the fallouts that have been experienced by some and also the many responsibilities placed on a Preacher’s kid.</p>
										<p align="justify">The book extensively dealt with the challenges faced by every child born in the homes of a Preacher/Pastor; the dual roles of being a child and also being a Preacher’s child, and that of being a Parent and also being the Pastor of your child. These roles are challenging and must be effectively carried out with wisdom and discernment by understanding the distinct roles and knowing when each of these roles must be carried out in effective parenting and pastoring.</p>
										<p align="justify">This book is a passionate expression of a concerned parent of Pastor’s Kids whose burden deserves to be shared. It is an uncommon book needed in the Church and society. The book although titled “CHALLENGES OF A PASTOR’S KID, does not emphasize the negatives about the status of Pastor’s children. It is a balanced approach to the realities affecting Pastor’s kids both in positive and negative sides.</p>
										<p align="justify">The author, Sam O. Salau, analyzed the numerous demands on Pastor’s kids without any specified training to qualify them for such demands. It is interesting to see the author confirming the call of God evident on Pastor’s kids through their parental “priesthood” and the beauty with blessings attached to it. By this, he encouraged the Pastor’s kids to value and protect the “priesthood” of their family.</p>
										<p align="justify">This book in its capacity commends the status of Pastor’s kids, corrects the errors of Pastor’s kids and recommends the roles of their parents, the church leaders and members to make them models and successors to the ministry of their parents.</p>
										<p align="justify">The author, Pastor Sam O. Salau is passionate about today and tomorrow of the Pastor’s Kids and the ministry of their Pastor parents. Those of like minds should purchase and circulate this book for the benefits of their Pastors and congregations. More than this, the book should be read, appropriated and applied.</p>

										Pastor Sam thanks a million for taking the challenge of writing a book on this sensitive aspect of life. Pastors are trained for ministry not their kids. This book is a 'school' for Pastors' Kids how I pray that the book will get to every pastor's home. The title reads CHALLENGES OF A PASTOR'S KIDS but it's a must read for every pastor as well. I will recommend this book to even church members as this will help them help the pastor and his family to fulfill ministry. Well done!</p>

										<p align="justify">It is a general knowledge that everyone expects so much from a Pastors’ child; they are not seen like the normal everyday child, rather they are seen as the perfect ones and expected to act like one. Sam. O. Salau has identified a whole lot of these challenges and has proffer solutions and also the best ways that would help anyone that is either a ‘PK’, or the Parents of a ‘PK’ to live out the fullness of what is expected of them by God.</p>
										<p align="justify">Sam. O. Salau has given a distinct analysis and broad knowledge of every individual that helps shape the lives of a ‘PK’. Challenges of Pastors’ Kids has been written in one of the most simplest forms to make reading interesting, lessons also learnt and applying the principles in the book easy to adapt.</p>
										<p align="justify">The in-depth of this book shows a lot of research was done. Everyone that has a relationship with a ‘PK’ would be doing a great help, building up, teachings and giving them the truth about their roles as a ‘PK’ when you make them read this book. This book has to be read by every Preacher/Pastor.</p>
										<p align="justify">Sam.O.Salau has done a wonderful work by writing this book and its certainly coming at the right time when our society needs it.</p>

										<hr>
										<p align="justify">Sam O. Salau has really put his hears on the ground to listen to the unconfessed challenges of the pastors' kids in all ramifications. He systematically proffers solutions both to the Pastors' Kids and their parents, including lay members. I recommend this book to all pastors' parents and their kids especially young singles going into the ministry.</p>

										<hr>
										<p align="justify">Finally we have a point of succor for the many challenges of the Pastor's kid. We thank God for the gift of Pastor Sam Salau and men like him who release their mind to conceive Divine Burden. This is a very rare but long-overdue piece that addresses a very peculiar subject. Some of us who have been Pastors' kids for over the quarter of a century cannot but strongly identify with this work. Still, for those of us who have chosen the path that our Fathers trod, it is all the more relevant. My reckoning is that this work is not only for the Pastor and his Kids, but also for everyone who has a Pastor and whose pastor has at least one kid.</p>
