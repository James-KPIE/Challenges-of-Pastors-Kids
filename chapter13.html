										<h2>PART FOUR:<br> VITAL RELATIONSHIPS OF PREACHERS KIDS</h2>
										<h2>Chapter Thirteen - WHAT EVERY MEMBER OWE THEIR PASTOR’S KIDS</h2><br><p align="center"><i style="color:red">A Word Of Challenge For Church Members</i></p>
										<p align="justify">
										This chapter is specially dedicated to church members who desire to help their Preacher’s Kids become better child and a stronger believer. According to a research done by Montgomery where adult children of pastors were surveyed, it was discovered that at least 80% of the entire Pastors’ Kids surveyed have had to seek professional help for depression. One may begin to wonder why this is so, and what is responsible for it.
										</p>
										The answer is not farfetched. Fighting the Preacher’s Kids is part of Satan's all-encompassing tactics against the church today. The families of those who spearhead the spiritual battles against the kingdom of hell are prime targets of demonic attacks. However, the painful part of it is that, much of these demonic attacks do not come from the unbelieving world, it is mostly from the members of the church to the Preacher’s Kids.

										So many Preachers’ Kid are becoming prodigal by the day and rebelling, and the cause of their problem are the church members, and there is not much that anyone is doing about it. If you are a genuine believer and a member of a particular church, do not join the devil to fight this battle against the pastor and his family. If you do, you will unconsciously be cooperating with the prime enemy of God to destroy the families of His Generals and cause them distractions at the war front. In order not to find yourself in this situation, there are things you may need to do and things you may need to stop doing. Some of these are explained below:
</p>
<h2>Do Not Forget He Is Just A Kid</h2>

<p align="justify">Do not see the Preacher’s Kid as the extension of the pastor, and thereby begin to expect him to be an example for his age-mates in church, just as his mother is an example to the women, and his father to the men. This perfection mentality is a great burden to bear for such a tender heart. It seems to be more difficult being a Preacher’s Kid than being a pastor. The Preacher’s Kids are denied the rights to either be normal or to live a normal life. Before you judge any Pastor’s Kid, view the issues firstly from his perspective as a kid, before considering that he is a Preacher’s Kid. This is because he is indeed just a kid; the preacher’s kid is just a description.
</p>
<p align="justify">Do not embarrass them in the public just because they do not know a verse of the scripture you think they should know. That their dad is your pastor does not mean they are born with a Bible software or app installed in the hard disk of their memory. You do not have to crucify a young lad for just a little mistake. Do not expect him to behave like a 40 year old man when he is just a 14 year old boy. Take it lightly with them. This is because your actions and your reactions to their actions, always affect them. Learn to give them some breathing space. Expect them to misbehave and make mistakes once in a while, just like any other kid. We all fall short sometimes in our own lives as well. So, do not make theirs look monumental! Preacher’s Kids are just pastor’s children and not Jesus. The earlier every church member gets this understanding, the better for all the parties involved.
</p>
<h2>Treat Them Like Yours</h2>

<p align="justify">If you bear in mind that they are little children, or growing teens, you will be able to treat them the way you will like yours to be treated. This is the golden rule: do unto others as you will like them to do unto you.
</p>
<p align="justify">God runs the same standard for everyone. He does not have one set of rules for the Preacher’s Kid and another set of rules for the other kids in the church. Whatever is good for the geese is good for the gander. Man may expect so much more from the Preacher’s Kid, but by God’s standard, whatever behavioral standard is acceptable for the Church Gateman’s kid is also acceptable for the Church Pastor’s Kid. He does not have double standards. His stand remains fixed, either for the rich or for the poor. He wants all to be holy.
</p>
<p align="justify">It is not your responsibility to become the Righteousness Legislator of the pastor’s family. If your pastor’s sermon is good enough for his kids, then it is good enough for yours too. Therefore, if you cannot expect a certain level of responsibility from your own children (or from yourself) don’t expect it from the Pastor’s Kids either.
</p>										
										
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
									
									<p align="justify">This is not to encourage laxity on the part of the Preacher’s Kids. But whatever high standard we create for the Preacher’s Kid, we should allow to run among all the teenagers and youths in the church so that one will not feel unfortunate being born into such a privileged home. Everyone in church should live a life that is pleasing unto God, and not just the Preacher’s Kid.
</p>
									<p align="justify">Don’t expect more from a Preacher’s Kid than you expect from your own children of their age mates. Being a Preacher’s Kid does not make them spiritual superstars overnight. Expect the same from them as you expect from your own kids. It is not fair on them to hold them to a very unrealistic standard while you hold your own kids to a reasonable standard. This is not supposed to mean we should lower the standards for them or that we should encourage them to engage in unscriptural activities, but that we should know that everyone is striving towards perfection, and if we must rebuke, we should rebuke in love, by rebuking everyone concerned, and not just the P.K.
</p>
<p align="justify">When it comes to a Preacher’s Kid, it is not about lowering our expectations; it is about having realistic expectations. Please understand that, just like you are in some areas of your life, and your children too in some areas of their lives, the Preacher’s Kids are also striving for perfection in certain areas of their lives, and should be given time to adjust their lives to certain levels that God expects of them, rather than push them off the limit until they stumble into more destruction and death, ultimately.
</p>
<h2>Meet Their Physical Needs</h2>

<p align="justify">The congregant of each assembly has more responsibility than it knows to care for and ease the burden of the pastor and his family. Too often the church has fostered a culture that puts enormous pressure on the pastor and his family without balancing it up by showing adequate concern for his welfare. It is this nonchalance that contributes to the burden Pastor’s Kids carry.
</p>
<p align="justify">Care about them, not just because of who their father is, but because of who they are as an individual. The Preacher’s Kids have feelings too. He has real needs like you and your kids too. Whatever your need is, so it is with your pastor. Whatever your spouse needs, your pastor’s spouse also will likely need. And whatever your kid needs, there is a great probability that your Pastor’s Kid needs the same. As much as the Lord has blessed you, be available to meet some of them; let them feel the grace of God upon your life. Make life a bit more comfortable for them than their parents can afford. Being instrumental of God for these provisions will endear their hearts to you.
</p>
<p align="justify">Some of these needs could be tangible, while others may be intangible, like sending them encouragement notes, soul lifting texts, etc. If you have a child of their age at home, it becomes very easy for you to know what they likely will need. Every preacher’s kid has the same need that an average kid has, hence, every good thing your child needs, they also need: The need to be shown love and care. Help him to become a better person by showing to them you really care. Send birthday presents. Make calls when they are off to school. Make them feel loved and cared for. This way, they will see you more as a member of their family, than as a member of their father’s church.
</p>
<h2>Correct Them In Love</h2>

<p align="justify">When any member of the church sins, their sins are easily forgiven and forgotten; but when a Preacher’s Kid sins, it becomes very difficult to be forgiven, and very impossible to be forgotten. Some church members even feel that the Preacher’s Kid should be punished more severely than all the other kids in church just to make a point. He serves as the sacrificial
										</p>

											<div style="text-align: justify;">lamb or the scape goat as the case may be.
      This is not fair. They also need the same range of grace that all the
      other children in church enjoy.<br>
      <br>
      Do more of showing them the love of Christ than the judgment of God.
      Tender hearts constantly exposed to the loving savior who died to take
      away the sins of the world will grow to become better believers than ones
      who only see the Judge of the Universe.<br>
      <br>
      Speak grace-filled words to them. Most church members need to be
      taught to be careful what they say and how they say it to a Preacher’s
      Kid. The sting of awful and unkind words spoken to some P.K.s as a kid can
      still keep biting them strongly, even at adulthood.<br>
      <br>
      Rather than keep reporting them all around, piling up accusations about
      them, or screaming them down when you find them where you think you should
      not, correct them in love and do not ask for their heads in exchange.
      Present them with suggestions on how to meet up with God’s expectations
      about them. Communicate what is expected of them to them in appreciable
      terms. Do not just assume they should know. Letting them know these
      realistic expectations beforehand will lessen the pressure on a Preacher’s
      Kid.<br>
      <br>
      <h2>Pray For Them</h2>
      Take time to pray for them. Prayer definitely works much more than screams
      and criticism. The hand that rules the world can make things straight for
      the uneasy head that wears the crown. How sweet will it be if about one
      out of ten members in church are praying for the Preacher’s Kid weekly
      from their own personal houses? No force on earth will be strong enough to
      withstand their spiritual progress. These prayers will make the church
      witness less of the Pastor’s Kids misbehaviors.<br>
      <br>
      Pray for him and his family a little bit more than you have always done.
      Instead of complaining, bring the pastor and his family, especially his
      children before the throne of grace, so that they can receive constant
      help in times of need. This will help them to remain strong in the Lord
      and in the power of his might at all times, especially against the evil
      forces seeking their downfall.<br>
      <br>
      Pray that God will help the children to walk in His ways. Pray that no
      attack of the evil one will cause them to fall. Pray for grace to live
      beyond peer pressures. Pray for an increasingly growing relationship with
      God. Pray for their career. Pray for their marriage. Pray for their
      academics. Pray for their spiritual. You will soon begin to notice the
      changes that only prayer can initiate in the life of a believer.<br>
      <br>
      <h2>Allow Them Choose Their Friends</h2>
      Do not assume an intimacy that does not exist. Allow them choose their
      friends; do not force any friendship on them. Friendship with them should
      be by choice and not by force. It is okay if you want to be their friend
      but it is also okay if they do not want to be your friend yet. They have a
      right to choose their friends.<br>
      <br>
      <h2>Address Them By Their First Name</h2>
      Call them by their names. If you do not know it, take the pain to ask.
      Calling them a name related to their father’s vocation already cages them
      in a tight corner, knowing fully well that all attention will be on them
      to watch what they do, say, or think. This could help them once in a
      while, but more often than not, it leaves the Preacher’s Kid with some
      form of psychological trauma. Even Jesus may not be happy if every
      reference to him in the scriptures reads “The Carpenter’s Son”; He was
      though called the Son of God, but He was also called the Son of Man, and
      most times, He was referred to, His first name was used, Jesus!<br>
      Speak No Evil Of Their Parents<br>
      <br>
      <br></div>
											
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="settings">
										<div style="text-align: justify;">Every time you talk evil of your pastor before your children, somehow, the
      Preacher’s Kids always get to hear, and they are not always happy about
      it. If you say or do anything that hurts their parents, you will end up
      hurting them too. They may not have the full gist of whatever happened,
      because their spiritually mature parents will most likely protect them
      from the negative events of the church, but somehow, they always get to
      know whenever there is strife and division in the church, and they can
      sense who is at the root of it all. They are likely going to take sides,
      and you can be sure they will defend their parents against you. If you
      don’t want to hurt them, don’t hurt their parents.<br>
      <br>
      Do not criticize their father in their presence. Every pastor who preaches
      at least an hour message twice a week for 52 weeks in a year will preach
      for an average of 104 hours in a year. If he counsels a minimum of two
      hours every day for a year, he will have spent 730 hours counseling. If he
      stays in the same church for 5 years, averagely, he would have spoken for
      4,170 hours. It takes the grace of God to speak that much without making a
      blunder once. This is why one can confidently say, no pastor is faultless.
      Every pastor will make a mistake that will most likely be talked about
      among his members. But be careful. Do not say it in the presence of his
      children in such a way that it will hurt them.<br>
      <br>
      Rather than spread gossips about them or their family, praise their father
      in their presence from time to time. Doing this makes them believe you
      really support their father’s ministry and that you want him to succeed.
      This endears you to their hearts and makes them love you the more.<br>
      Settle Issues Amicably<br>
      <br>
      If you have issues with their father, call him aside, and tell him what
      the issues are so that both parties can iron it out amicably. This is
      better than saying things behind him.<br>
      <br>
      Everything you say behind the pastor gets to the hearing of his kids, and
      they really will not be too excited to know that you are the one passing
      such hurting comments about their dads. Gossiping and complaining makes
      them feel that the church that denies them their preacher parent’s
      attention still complains that his best is still not good enough for the
      church.<br>
      <br>
      <h2>Treasure Their Parent’s Time</h2>
      Protect their father’s time. Do not be part of any high demanding
      expectations that will put great pressures on their father’s time such
      that will hinder him from fulfilling his fatherly role at home.<br>
      Do not put your pastor or his spouse in a situation where he will have to
      choose between the church and his children. You will be putting him in a
      very tight corner.<br>
      <br>
      <h2>Appreciate Their Efforts</h2>
      Appreciate them too for their commitments in the church, no matter how
      little. One of the many ways to make a positive and lasting impression on
      a Preacher’s Kid is to make positive comments about them frequently. These
      comments, coming from people other than their parents, especially coming
      from a church member, can go a long way to help them build up a strong
      self-image that is needed to succeed later on in life.<br>
      <br>
      <h2>Give them attention</h2>
      If your Preacher’s Kid happens to want to share something with you, please
      give them your full attention. His father has been attending to church
      issues and counseling members so much so that he has used up his words and
      comes home tired, not looking for any opportunity to talk or listen to
      anyone again. All he wants is to rush his dinner, have a shower, mumble a
      few words of prayers, and jumps on his bed, awaiting the dawning of a new
      day before he resumes the same cycle.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      So there is so much bottled up in a Pastor’s Kid with no one to share it
      with. If they have decided to confide in you, that means they have seen
      you as a worthy friend, do not let them down. No matter how insignificant
      the information is, it is important to them; so do well to listen. Even if
      you do not have the right advice to give to them, you may want to
      introduce them to someone who does, and if they refuse your offer, it
      means all they want is just someone with a listening ear, someone to
      confide in. You may just keep interceding for them.<br>
      <br>
      <h2>Do Not Blame Your Pastor For His Kids Choices</h2>
      In case one of your Preacher’s Kids decides to misbehave, stop blaming the
      parent for the choices of the children. Godly parents may cultivate the
      soil and make it ready for the reception of the word, but no one can make
      the decision for his child. The onus lies on the child to do whatever he
      feels right, especially as he grows up and he is no longer under the full
      control of his preacher parents. Your pastor is already feeling bad that
      one of his children is misbehaving and putting him to shame. Do not make
      it worse for him by rubbing it in the more. Rather than making your pastor
      feel worse for it, especially if you know he had tried his best, encourage
      him and join him in prayers for the life of his wayward child. He will see
      you more as a friend this way, and heaven will recognize you as a partner
      in his ministry.
