    <h2>SWITCHING CHURCHES</h2>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><code><u><i><b>Changing From Your Father’s
              Church<br>
              <br>
            </b></i></u></code></div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">It is not unusual for a grown up
      Preacher’s Kid to begin to feel, for so many reasons best known to him,
      uncomfortable worshipping in his parents’ home church. There is nothing
      wrong with you desiring to find your own church; a church where you feel
      at home and very relaxed to worship God in the best way you feel right.
      This desire may become very strong in your heart when your father’s church
      no longer meets your present spiritual needs.<br>
      <br>
      At this time, desiring a place of worship where you will have the full
      liberty to worship God the best way you wish is not asking for too much.
      This will give you the opportunity to feel spiritually secure in the midst
      of your friends, a place where you can be reached out to, and where you
      can be loved for who you are, and not for being a Preacher’s Kid. However,
      you must first be aware that, as good as this decision sounds, and with
      all the benefits it has for you, you will need your father’s endorsement
      before you can proceed with it, especially if you still live under the
      same roof with him.<br>
      <br>
      Candidly, it does not speak well that you attend a separate church from
      that which your father pastors, as long as you still live together; you
      may be sending a wrong signal out. If everyone who does not like at least
      one thing about your father’s church leaves the church, he will have no
      one to pastor again. Your best bet is to still find a way of making your
      father’s ministry look like what you desire, as much as he allows you.
      Your presence during regular church programs may seem to you like enough
      encouragement to him, but you can go a step further, by getting seriously
      committed in the church activities.<br>
      <br>
      This period of time while you are still there, keep looking for other
      avenues to affect the church positively. Find something meaningful to do
      in the church that can be your own contribution to the success of the
      ministry. You will discover that if you get seriously involved, even if
      you have cause to leave his roof to start a family of your own, you may
      find it difficult to leave the church because you have a part of you in
      the ongoing work.<br>

										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										<div style="text-align: justify;">
										
      Whatever differences you have with the church your father pastors, you can
      sit down and talk about it. Rather than back out, you can introduce the
      changes you desire to see in the church to him and let him see reasons why
      you feel it has to be done at that same season, giving examples of places
      where it has been done and the results they have experienced.<br>
      The final decision still lies with him anyway. He may accept it and he may
      refuse it. Even if he accepts the first one, it does not mean he will
      always accept every innovation or renovation you want done in the church.
      If he accepts this, be appreciative and make all the necessary moves you
      need to put all the necessary things in place to ensure the idea succeeds.
      The success of this idea can be a great opportunity for you to introduce
      more of such great ideas.<br>
	  <br>
										The fact that you have seen something work in another church and it has
      increased their attendance or their finances does not mean it will work in
      your church. Not all things work for all churches. Doing what everyone is
      doing most times is not always the answer. One needs to find what uniquely
      works for one and stick to it. You may not know how many things your
      father has tried his hands on in ministry before sticking to the
      operational methods he has adopted today.<br>
	  <br>
      If he does not accept your proposal this first time, he may accept it some
      other time. Before you begin to feel bitter because of this, ask for his
      reasons. Most times, what a child does not see standing up, an adult sees
      from where he sits. He must surely have good reasons for saying no to a
      brilliant idea.<br>
	  <br>
	  If what you want is the growth of your father’s church, and your father
      also desires that his church grows, then two rights does not make a wrong
      (that is the opposite of the popular cliché ‘two wrongs does not make a
      right’). Since all of your ideas and all of your father’s actions are in
      the best interest of the church, two of you can harmonize your plans for
      the church to make the best of what God has given to you.<br>

                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="messages">
										<div style="text-align: justify;">
		
      One reason why your father would have rejected a great idea may be because
      of his level of exposure, although he may not admit it. It is not easy to
      teach an old dog a new trick. Some pastors are so inflexible that they
      find it difficult to change their methods or adapt to the changing culture
      around their community, even when their members begin to leave. You will
      not blame him much. This is because change is not always an easy thing.
      Resting in your comfort zone is much more comfortable than taking a blind
      leap into uncharted waterways.<br>
      <br>
      One major cause of this lack of exposure may be because your father does
      not read any author that is not from his own theological flow. He is
      exposed, but does not have a balanced exposure. The only people he reads
      or listens to are the ones who thinks like him, dresses like him, writes
      like him, reasons like him, preaches like him, and so he becomes a
      theologically overfed personality, without desiring to examine others’
      perspectives on such theologies.<br>
      <br>
      There is not much you can do about this. You can only help him become
      better by getting him books, tapes, Cds and messages that addresses such
      issues written by authors who are not from his theological flow. If he
      listens to what others are saying about the issues, and read what others
      have written, he may be moved by the Holy Spirit to change his stand. Even
      if he still does not change his stand, he will be much more exposed and
      will be grateful to you for that.<br>
      <br>
      In getting him these materials, you will need to be selective in your
      choice. Since you know he naturally will not read or listen to some class
      of preachers, getting him materialsfrom such class of ministers may really
      not motivate him to read the books or listen to the audios you have
      invested so much money on, and until the materials are digested, there may
      not be any physical change in his operations. A simple way out is to
      source for the teaching material on the same issues, of someone he readily
      will listen to, or someone he holds in high regards. He will readily
      listen to such than someone whom he has some level of reservations for
      already. <br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, get him a neutral author whom he has not heard before. This
      may also perform the needed miracle.<br>
      <br>
      If you get yourself this busy with activities in your father’s church, you
      may begin to notice that your services are actually more needed here than
      any other place you desire to switch to.<br>

										<h2 style="text-align: justify;">YOU WANT TO LEAVE BY ALL MEANS</h2>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">But if you finally decide you want to
      leave by all means, before you make this move, firstly understand that
      there are no perfect churches anywhere. You may not see in another church
      whatever you see that discourages you from your father’s church, but be
      assured that the new church you intend joining has its own weakness too.
      If you find it difficult to cope with your family church, you may find it
      more difficult to cope in an unfamiliar terrain. This may be the beginning
      of many years’ journey of shopping for the right church!<br>
      <br>
      Pray about it and be sure God is leading you to move. If indeed he is
      leading you, he will guide you to the right place of worship that will
      save you the stress of shopping for a good church.<br>
      <br>
      After careful consideration and a candid assurance that you are
      prayerfully led to do this, let him know of your decision early enough. Do
      not expect that he will celebrate you when he hears; so be prepared for
      the worst. If your preacher father is like every other, he really will not
      take it lightly with you. Most fathers won’t. But still be sure he hears
      it from your mouth than from an external person.<br>
      <br>
      Before you can do this, be sure you are above the age of accountability.
      If you decide to do this before you are mature enough, you may be forced
      to suffer things you do not bargained for. This is because, for now, what
      your father understands by leaving his church is equal to leaving God. He
      may withdraw so many privileges from you in order to have you come back to
      his fold. So, wait until the time is ripe, when you are old enough to
      stand on your own. Then, let your father know that although you are
      leaving his church, you are not leaving the Lord. Tell him that you love
      him and appreciate him as a father, but not as a church pastor.<br>
      <br>
      One very easy way to do this is to wait until you are old enough to stay
      on your own, and then get his consent to move out of the pastoral family
      house. This done, you can get an accommodation in a place that is quite
      far from the family church, say two hours’ drive away from home. This way,
      you will have a good excuse to change church, since he does not expect you
      to drive two hours every day to come worship in the family church.
