										<h2>Chapter Sixteen</h2>
    <h2>TAKING OVER THE PASTORAL BATON</h2>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">If you are raised as a Preacher’s Kid,
      people’s opinion generally about you is that you will either end up as a
      pastor if you are a male or a pastor’s spouse if you are a female. If you
      are the first son of a great preacher, one statement you cannot run away
      from is “You are going to be a great preacher like your father”. And most
      of the church members who say this to you really mean what they are
      saying.<br>
      <br>
      Everyone expects you to take the mantle from your father, whether you have
      what it takes or not. This is not very fair. Initially, during your
      growing up years, this statement may excite you and give you some sense of
      ego or pride. But as you grow older and consider the enormous
      responsibilities of the office, coupled with the expectations of the
      people about you, you may begin to have a rethink.<br>
      <br>
      This is another area where most Pastors’ Kids have issues with their
      parents; when it comes to who should take over from their father in the
      ministry, most especially if the church is founded by their father. Most
      General Overseers of churches have secretly nursed the thoughts and many
      at times conclude the plans of handing over the leadership baton of their
      churches and ministries to their children just before they retire from
      active service or as soon as they die (whichever comes first) and so have
      silently trained the innocent and unassuming young man what to do when he
      gets into ministry, whether he desires it or not.<br>
      <br>
      The young man may not even be aware of what future his aged preacher
      father has planned for him. He may just be very active in the church,
      offering his own heartfelt services unto God. But unknown to him, it is
      possible that his father is consciously grooming him for a greater
      service. His growing up years are shaped by the calling of his father.
      From going to funerals, weddings, christenings and the likes, he has his
      whole life colored with church related activities. This becomes a very
      serious issue whenever he is let into his father’s plan for him,
      especially if he is not really interested in active ministry<br>

										<h2>A WORD OF CAUTION FOR THE PK</h2>
      One main reason your father (and others like him who are canvassing that
      you take over the leadership of the church) have is that Pastor’s Kids are
      one of the most spiritually advanced leaders of the church today. Due to
      their backgrounds and what they have been exposed to earlier in life, they
      tend to understand the demands of the ministry much more than a green
      horn, and have unconsciously developed better administrative and
      leadership skills over the years. Since most people who go to Bible School
      in order to become a pastor only attends few years of lectures, spending
      your life in a pastoral family as a P.K. therefore becomes a valuable
      training ground for ministry in the future. But ministry is much more than
      that.<br>
      <br>
      <b>It Is Not Automatic</b><br>
      The work of ministry cannot be done with just experience alone, there has
      to be a divine call. You must understand and let your father also realize
      that growing up in a pastor’s house does not mean you must necessarily
      become a pastor. The word “Pastor” is not a family title. The fact that
      your father’s friend who also doubles as a pastor, just like your dad,
      handed over the mantle of leadership to his son does not mean your father
      must hand his to you. If you are lucky to be called, embrace it. If you
      are not, run away from it.<br>
      <br>
      For the first forty years of his life, Moses grew up in the palace. He ate
      what Pharaoh’s sons ate, drank what they drank, learnt all they knew, and
      practically was becoming one of them. But his purpose and destiny in life
      was different from what they were raising him to be. Although he was being
      prepared to be the next Pharaoh, heaven had a different assignment for
      him, a more glorious one. By divine providence, God moved him out of the
      place where almost all that he had learnt will be useful primarily, to an
      area where he had to start learning new things.<br>
      <br>
      People will place this huge demand on you to continue the ministry of your
      father, but you have a choice either to, or not. Not all Pastors’ Kids
      will become pastors; just as all doctor’s children do not necessarily have
      to become doctors.<br>
      <b><br>
        Be Sure Of Your Calling First</b><br>
      Your father may have great hopes in you. He might have prepared you to
      take over the throne after him, but you must first convince yourself that
      you are really cut out for what you are about to be pushed into. There is
      no problem if you really desire it and heaven intends it. It makes things
      very easy for both you and your father. If you are sure of the call of God
      on your life and you are certain that He will want you to take over the
      baton of leadership, then you really have no other choice than to yield to
      His leadings. You do not have to struggle with his will for your life. But
      you really need to be sure that you are called before taking up the
      responsibility. If it is not a true calling into the pastoral or any of
      the fivefold ministry, you will only commit yourself to a daily experience
      that can be likened to living in a nightmare, no matter the affluence
      attached to the office. But if you have a genuine call of God upon your
      life, continuing where your father stops will give you a very big leverage
      in life to accomplish much more than he has done.<br>
      <br>
      Enough good examples of this are all around us: Kenneth Higgins Jnr took
      over from his father Kenneth Hagins, Franklin Graham from Billy Graham,
      Joel Osteen from John Osteen, and there is even every possible indication
      that the likes of David Oyedepo and John Hagee who are presently in their
      old age will definitely hand over to their sons once they retire, going by
      the present organogram of the ministry. But in a case where it is not in
      God’s blueprint for your life, your father’s desire and your own interest
      notwithstanding, you may not have a successful ministry like your father.
      Stories abound of churches and ministries like this too, but names of such
      ministries will not be mentioned in this book to save their faces.<br>
      <br>
      Man does not call into the ministry, God does, and the criteria God looks
      at before calling into the ministry is not the same as the qualities man
      considers. Man looks at the face but God looks into the deepest intentions
      of the heart. Some of the things that men consider are; eloquence,
      experience, ability, professionalism, longevity in the church,
      relationship with the pastors and the likes. These are not even anything
      near what God considers.

										<div style="text-align: justify;">
										What it takes to be in ministry is much more than just having a flair for
      it; it is a unique calling that is backed up by the anointing and the
      grace of God upon one’s life. If these two are not there, whatever the
      eloquence level, one may find it tough down the lane.<br>
      <br>
      Do not let your friends convince you to take what you do not deserve. Do
      not let your father force it on you. Do not let your pride, ego or
      covetousness deceive you into believing you are the right heir to the
      throne of your father because of the remunerations involved. Jonathan Saul
      may rightly be the legal heir to the throne of King Saul over the house of
      Israel, but God had prepared another man by the name of David, who though
      may not be related in any way to the throne and has no royalty in his
      dynasty, but who has the backing of the God of Israel and has been endowed
      with the needed virtues to run the affairs of the house of Israel. He is
      the real heir.<br>
      <br>
      <b>In Case You Desire It</b><br>
      On the other hand, some Preacher’s Kids desire it and naturally covet it,
      whether their father has prepared them for it or not. There is nothing
      sincerely wrong with this. The Bible says whosoever desires the office of
      a bishop desires a good thing. All you need do is go to God in prayers and
      let Him know you desire such. He will lead you into His perfect will for
      your life. If He is sure you do not just desire it for selfish interest,
      or because of the material wealth that your father has built over the
      years, you can be sure that He will find good use of you, since the
      harvest is much and the laborers are few. But do not take such decision by
      yourself, get Him involved.<br>
      <br>
      <b>It May Not Be Easy</b><br>
      If you genuinely feel God is not calling you to take over the ministry
      from them, do not expect your parent to take it lightly with you,
      especially if you have been groomed for this purpose. It will be a very
      hard decision for them to accept that the ministry they have devoted all
      of their lives to, and have pumped all of their resources into, do not
      mean as much to you as it does to them, and that you will rather find
      something different to hold onto as your purpose for living. Their
      reaction is easier imagined than experienced. At such moments, you will
      need godly wisdom and superior counsel from reliable mentors to manage the
      situation.<br>

										 <b>Discover Your Purpose</b><br>
      If you are not going to take over the baton of leadership from your father
      in the ministry, then you must decide what you want to do with your life
      early enough before someone begins to make some unsatisfactory
      recommendations for you. The challenge with most ministers’ kids is that
      they really do not carve a peculiar niche for themselves in a unique area
      until someone begins to carve one for them. They are made to discover
      their ministry - related abilities before they discover any other ability
      about their lives.<br>
      <br>
      If you do not want this to happen to you, you must discover yourself
      first. Ask yourself, what am I cut out for? What am I very good at, if it
      is not ministry? Where do I find ultimate fulfillment? Honest answers to
      these questions will open your eyes to numerous latent abilities and
      potentials lying untapped in your life. If you will begin to invest in any
      of them, it may make people who think you are only cut out for ministry
      alone begin to see other aspects of your life, and they may begin to
      rescind their decisions about you.<br>
      <h2>A WORD OF ADVICE TO THE PREACHER PARENT</h2>
      Never assume that your child will eventually end up in ministry; you are
      not the caller, He is. This kind of assumption may get you disappointed if
      he turns down your offer after high school. God is the only one who calls
      into the ministry; do not snatch this responsibility from him. If he
      chooses to call, or not to call your grown up child, so be it.<br>
      <br>
      You need to know that every child is different in some way. The fact that
      your pastor friend’s son took over the mantle of leadership after him in
      his ministry does not mean that it is the ideal thing for every minister’s
      son to do. That it has worked for one does not mean it will work for all.
      You can put your child under unnecessary pressure if you reason this way.<br>
      <br>
      Even if you are too sure that He has called your child, it is left to him
      to willing obey the call, and not for you to forcefully bend him into
      obedience. You can only advise, encourage, and make ministry enticing and
      inviting to him; scheming your way to make it work will be more like Mrs.
      Rebekah Isaac trying to push her son, Jacob Isaac into the prophetic
      destiny that was meant for him by conspiring with him against his twin
      brother, Esau Isaac. That single action meant to help Jacob fulfill
      destiny actually elongated his journey towards destiny, since it was not
      done God’s way.
