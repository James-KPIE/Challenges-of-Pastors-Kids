            <h2>Chapter Fourteen - THE LOVE LIFE OF<br>
              A PREACHER’S KID</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><code><i><u>A Word Of Advice For The
                    Preacher’s Kid</u></i></code></p>
            <div style="text-align: justify;">One other major challenge you can have as
      a Pastor’ Kid, which if you do not carefully handle can cause a major
      friction between you and your parents is in the choice of a life partner.
      Your marital life is not only of interest to you, it is also of vital
      interest to your parents and ultimately to God. So, you need to take
      serious care before making a choice.<br>
      <br>
      The greatest challenge in making a choice may likely come from your
      parents, although they have good intentions. Aside your parents and God,
      everyone in church also feels they have a say in your relationship. All
      the elders and other pastors in the church begin to think that you need
      their endorsements before going ahead to ask for the hand of the person
      you love in marriage. It is even possible that some of them, because of
      your familiarity with them, begin to recommend a spouse for you, despite
      the fact that they never lived a day of their lives with you to know your
      likes and dislikes.<br>
      <br>
      So many factors should be of great consideration in the final choice of
      who to marry, because you are now, in a sense, a public figure in your own
      little domain. Some of them are very important while some of them are of
      less importance and looks quite insignificant but still carries some
      weight in your final decision. More often than not, these factors which
      you feel are really not important may be the major determinant of your
      preacher parent's acceptability of your choice in marriage.<br>
      <br>
      One of such is in the relational attitude of your spouse-to-be with other
      members of the church. A partner that lives a controversial life or has
      personal issues or unresolved crisis with a number of people in your
      father’s ministry or one whose lifestyle and beliefs contradicts what your
      father preaches may pose a serious threat to the success of your
      relationship than one who has a better relationship with others and who
      has a supportive doctrinal beliefs with your father, especially if you
      have been groomed to take over the ministry after your parents!<br>
      <br>
      Whatever choice you make, always take it to God in prayers for
      confirmations before proceeding with your desires. The place of God's will
      cannot be downplayed. You are a minister's child, and should be careful of
      choosing for yourself. Allow God to lead you in making a choice. Every
      time a man makes choices outside God, he bears the consequences of his
      decisions alone. But if he is led by God, he makes the best choice of all
      available options.<br>
      <h2>WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN YOUR</h2>
      <h2>CHOICE OF A LIFE PARTNER</h2>
      1. <b>SPIRITUAL MATURITY</b><br>
      The number one requirement of the spouse of a Pastor’s Kid is that he/she
      must be spiritually sound. This is more important than every other,
      especially if you have a soft spot for the ministry and may likely end up
      therein in the future. Whoever must be your spouse must have a balanced
      spiritual life; anything less than this may spark a lot of controversies
      between you and your preacher parents.<br>
      2.<b> LOVE</b><br>
      The place of love cannot be overemphasized. You must love whoever you are
      going to marry. You should be careful not to fall into the temptation of
      getting engaged to someone who meets all of the qualifications of the
      church’s marriage committee but meets very few or none of yours. You know
      what you want, and you should be in the best place to decide who you want.
      Do not be forced into someone else’s mode.<br>
      <br>
      Do not let someone cage you with the idea of "the will of God". If love is
      not there, it cannot be God, because God is love. Even if your parents
      make recommendations, make sure you are in love with their choice for you,
      or simply turn the offer down respectively.<br>
      <br>
      Undertaking the task of searching for a spouse that will meet the
      qualification of, and that will be loved by every single person in your
      parent’s ministry, may make marriage become next to impossible. What is
      important is that you both love yourself. It does not matter who else in
      church that does not!<br>
      3.<b> BEAUTY</b><br>
      Beauty is a major factor when making your considerations. You sure do not
      want to marry someone who is neither appealing to you in your privacy nor
      presentable to others at your public events. Although, all of God’s
      creations are beautiful, but not all of these beautiful ones looks
      beautiful to everyone; because beauty, as you know, is in the eyes of the
      beholder. So you must make sure that the person of your choice is
      beautiful in your eyes, and for peace’s sake, in your parents’.<br>
      4. <b>CHARACTER</b><br>
      Sincerely speaking, most Pastors’ Kids will not have any issue with
      marrying a physically attractive spouse. By the virtue of their position
      in and relevance to the church, they naturally attract to themselves some
      of the most beautiful members of the opposite sex in their father’s
      church, their father’s friends’ churches or in their immediate community.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore they likely will find it very easy to get someone with the outer
      beauty. However, possession of outer beauty has nothing to do with the
      inner beauty. A lady may be very beautiful outwardly, but she needs to
      balance it inwardly. A young man may be very handsome physically but still
      behave like a monster. The major issue here will be character. The
      determinant of your choice should not just be the facial attraction or
      shapes and curves of the body alone, but more importantly the state of the
      heart. Because of the privileged position you occupy, good character
      cannot be compromised. Beauty is really desirable, but much more than
      beauty, character is the ‘real’ thing. The beauty is just an added icing
      on the cake.<br>
          </div>
		  </div>
          <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
           <div style="text-align: justify;">
			Some of the characters to watch out for in your intending spouse, amongst
      others are; submission to your parents, respect for members of your
      parents church and the church doctrines, humility, teachability, charisma
      and submission to her spouse if she is a lady. These will help you decide
      if you are falling in love with just an attractive face, or with an
      innocent soul.<br>
      <br>
      Once you can ascertain that your spouse to be possess at least these four
      qualities, he has the needed criteria to be a life partner. The only
      challenge after this is, What does God think about your choice, and what
      do your parents think about the same? These are the three important
      factors in the equation, God, your parents, and yourself. God’s part is
      settled, yours also is settled, and it remains your parents.<br>
      <h2>SETTLING PARENTAL CONFLICTS IN YOUR CHOICE</h2>
      Understand this; it is difficult for any parent, not just a preacher
      parent, to fully trust their children to make some convincing destiny
      choices without offering their unsolicited opinions. Although in reality,
      what most adult-children want is independence, but what most parents want
      is dependence. This is another issue that constantly causes disagreements
      between Preacher’s Kids and their parents.<br>
      <br>
      This is always most pronounced at the stage of making a choice of a life
      partner. If you are like most Pastors’ Kids, you may be denied your
      freedom of emotional expression to love whoever you desire. Your parents,
      most likely may already have someone in mind whom they feel will be a
      better spouse to you. The problem is that they will refuse to disclose
      this to you until the time you finally decide to introduce to them the
      found love of your life. It keeps you wondering for how long they have
      been nursing this intention and have successfully hidden it from you. What
      will surprise you most is that both of your parents have met severally
      over the issue and have reached a final conclusion about this aspect of
      your future without your involvement in the decision making or your
      consent on their choice.<br>
      <br>
      There really is no problem in a father desiring the best for his child.
      The challenge is that most times, their choice for you will likely be very
      different from whom you desire for yourself in life. They most likely will
      prefer you marry another Pastor’s child, or a pastor in the church, or
      someone with a calling into the ministry, or from the family of another
      member of the church who is so supportive to their parent’s ministry.
      There is nothing wrong with this, if it is okay with you, and if you have
      not gotten involved in any serious relationship yet. It only makes your
      task of making a godly choice very east. However, this is not always the
      case.<br>
      <br>
      It always becomes a very serious issue when you do not accept ‘this’ their
      choice for you and you fall in love with someone else. Their choice is
      always labeled God’s choice for your life (and they may be right anyway);
      therefore not yielding to their will is seen as disobedience, especially
      if the person of your choice does not fit into the mold of an ideal
      Pastor’s Kid’s husband/wife, as seen by your denomination.<br>
      <br>
      When such contrary views arise as to whom to date, it cannot be settled by
      being stubborn or heady. It may demand a lot of maturity and patience of
      you. If you make your<br>
      <br>
      stand known, and you are not wavy in your opinion, things will likely work
      out the way you desire it, God willing!<br>
      <br>
      At such a crucial time as this, both parties must be willing to come to
      the realization of their need for one another. Let there be a mature
      interdependence on each other. Let the child know there are things his
      parents have noticed about their choice which they feel is best for him
      and will make him a better person. Let the parents also know that such
      decisions cannot be taken without the full consent of the person in
      question. Let each party trust each other and also respect each other’s
      opinion. Highlighted here are some of the steps you can take if such issue
      arise.<br>
      1. <b>Make a Wish List:</b><br>
      Write out a list of all the virtues you ever desire in a spouse which you
      have found in your choice. Be very comprehensive; add both physical and
      spiritual qualities. Ensure every good thing you have ever liked about
      your choice gets into the list.<br>
      2. <b>Convince Yourself</b><br>
      You need to be sure you know what you are doing, and that you are not just
      fantasizing over vanities. So, go a step further to explain the reasons
      you desire each of these virtues. It is possible to get easily carried
      away without knowing it. Convince yourself that you are not making a wrong
      choice by explaining the importance of each of these qualities, not just
      to your present, but to your future.<br>
      3. <b>Compare With The Alternative</b><br>
      Compare the two options available to you by highlighting the virtues which
      the spouse your parents offer you lacks out of all the desired virtues. We
      are not trying to base our choice on human calculations, we are only
      trying to resolve the issue between you and your parents, since both of
      you are already sure that your choice is God’s choice. So it is a win-win
      situation; whichever way, you are in safe hands.<br>
      4. <b>Open Up To Them</b><br>
      Show a copy of the first list to the one you are closer to between your
      parents and explain it to him/her. Let him/her know the things you desire
      in a life partner without revealing your choice to him/her. Based on this
      list, let him/her see the shortcomings of the one they are recommending to
      you. Tell him/her your fears in going into a relationship with such a one
      and let him/her join you in prayers. Him/her may choose to add to the list
      or remove from it, but do not argue with any objections, just listen
      patiently to the argument.

          </div>
          <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="messages">
            <div style="text-align: justify;">
			This done, you will have scored a point with your parents; they now know
      that you really know what you want out of life, you know what is best for
      you, and so you are matured enough to take thought provoking decisions.
      This will gladden their hearts a lot, although they may not show it.<br>
      5. <b>Present It To God</b><br>
      Prayerfully ask God to work on all the parties involved, your preference,
      their preference, yourself, and themselves. Pray that God touch the hearts
      of your parents to help you make the right choice. Pray that the right
      choice will be willing to patiently wait for you until your parents are
      convinced of the decisions. Pray that whatever alternative that is not in
      God’s best interest for you being offered you by anyone will not work out
      in their favor, no matter how hard they try. Pray also for yourself that
      the Lord will take over your heart so that you will be ready to receive
      the best He has for you, whichever of the alternative it may be.<br>
      <br>
      6. <b>Wait On God</b><br>
      Give God time to work on all the parties involved. Good things take time,
      so give it time. God does not do His things in a hurry, but He also does
      not do it late. He is aware of whatever pressure you are going through on
      this case; at the right time, he will surface. He makes all things
      beautiful in His time.<br>
      7. <b>Recommend Your Choice</b><br>
      If nothing happens in a few months after that, make your desired
      recommendation to your parents for prayers. By this time, if they really
      want the best for you, they will understand your fears, more importantly
      since the person they have vouched for does not have most of the virtues
      you desire in a spouse and does not show any desire to improve and become
      the person you really desire.<br>
      8. <b>Review The Benefits</b><br>
      Let them go through the list again and show them reasons why your choice
      still seems preferable to you than theirs. Let them pray about it.<br>
      9. <b>Involve A Mentor</b><br>
      If after all of these, they still insist on their choice for you, get
      someone they love and respect to talk to them about it, say, a fellow
      minister, a close friend of theirs, or their mentor.<br>
      10. <b>Let God Take Charge</b><br>
      Leave the rest to God. He makes all things beautiful in his own time.<br>
      <h2>LIVING WITH YOUR CHOICE</h2>
      The divorce rate today in the Christian church is very alarming, even
      among pastors. It looks as though God has closed His eyes on divorce and
      it does not matter much to Him whether one marries once or remarries
      multiple times over. This is not really encouraging. True marriage has no
      expiry date: it spans a lifetime, hence the popular saying at wedding;
      till death do us part! Irrespective of what the society believes, God's
      standard cannot be compromised. One man and one woman is His
      recommendation, and so shall it remain.<br>
      <br>
      Once you finally decide who to settle for, you must make up your mind with
      your spouse that there is no going back after marriage. Make up your mind
      to make it work. You do not have to look for reasons for divorce if what
      you want is to scatter the home; you will have as many as possible. But if
      you must continually live together, you must jointly look for reasons why
      you must stay together on daily basis. If your marriage fails, it will
      bring more reproach to God and much more shame to your parents and the
      church they oversee. The society may say divorce does not matter, but it
      is God who determines whether it does or not, and He still insists it
      does!<br>
      <br>
      Before you tie the knots, you can change your mind for as many times as
      you choose to, although you need to be careful not to put yourself in such
      situation. Once the knot is tied, both of you will have to decide on what
      to do to work it out successfully. You must be willing to respect one
      another's feelings from time to time and forgive one another as occasions
      demand.

			Every relationship has its own challenges. Every marriage has its ups and
      down. There is no marriage that has ever succeeded without its own unique
      unbearable situation. Yours also may not be an exception. You would have
      some uncomfortable times at the home front which is not just unique to
      Pastor’s Kids alone. Your ability to face whatever challenges that come
      your way selflessly and in unity will keep both of you together beyond the
      period of these challenges. It will also help you to overcome those
      challenges easily and stresslessly.<br>
      <br>
      A wise man once said that "there are three rings in every marriage, the
      engagement ring, the wedding ring, and the unpalatable ring". The first
      two rings are very admirable, but not the last one. Every marriage where
      the last one is not well handled always ends in divorce. If the two of you
      are not united, both at palatable times and at the challenging periods, it
      will be practically impossible to achieve great feats.<br>
      <br>
      If both of you really desire to stick together till the end, at the
      initial stage, you both should sit down and make a compilation of factors
      that you know which are likely going to ruin your relationships and
      proffer solutions to them in advance.<br>
      <br>
      Some of the things you will need to discuss in advance are<br>
      1. Money management in marriage<br>
      2. Sexual interactions with each other<br>
      3. Timely crisis resolution<br>
      4. What church to identify with after marriage, your father's or another<br>
      5. If another, what shall be your level of commitment to your father's
      ministry<br>
      6. What factors will determine what Church to attend<br>
      7. Dealing with the in laws<br>
      8. Understanding the primary needs of each other, emotional, academic etc<br>
      9. Career development for both of you<br>
      10. Handling the opposite sex:<br>
      <br>
      On a final note, whatever it will take, be faithful to your spouse..
      Infidelity scatters more home than all other factors put together.
