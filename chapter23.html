        <h2>Appendix</h2>
        <h2>Chapter Twenty Three</h2>
        <h2>Is My Child Really Born Again?</h2>
      
      <code><i>A Word of Advice To All Christian Parent</i></code><br>
      Another major cause of rebellion in among Christian Kids as they grow up
      is a lack of genuine relationship with God. Every Christian Parent needs
      to be sure his growing up kids are sincerely born again.<br>
      <br>
      When kids are brought up in Christian homes, we are always quick to assume
      that they are believers from birth and expect them to act like one, any
      day, anywhere, anytime. And this is exactly what most of them do; act it
      so perfectly that we do not know they are not one! They become just like
      an actor who is chosen to cast a major character in a stage play.<br>
      <br>
      Their staying around believers everyday of their life is enough rehearsal
      sessions for them to know what to say, what to do, how to dress, and
      whatsoever is expected of a believer at every particular point in time.
      Though the Bible reveals that by their fruits we shall know them, but
      these ones know the exact good fruits fellow believers are on the watch
      out for and they are careful enough to produce just that, anytime they are
      around someone who may be disappointed if they produce otherwise, although
      they are capable of producing worse than that, especially when occasions
      demand.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ADOPTED RELIGION</b><br>
      They may presently be going through a serious internal spiritual dilemma
      about their faith but it seldom reflects in their outward appearance
      initially. This spiritual wrestling going on in their hearts is always
      because their confession of Christianity as their choice of religion is
      more of a family tradition, which is far from confessing Christ as their
      Lord and Savior. The former is a prepackaged faith, handed over to them by
      their father, which is meant to be handed over to their own sons, while
      the latter is a profession of sound spiritual depth, oozing out from a
      grace filled heart and faith that is tried, tested and proven.<br>
      <br>
      The whole struggle and dissatisfaction comes from the fact that they do
      not know Jesus personally but they are not mature enough to realize that,
      they are just kids. Most Christian Kids who attends Sunday School
      regularly know more about Jesus than almost every one of their mates. But
      that's just it - they know all about Jesus, but that doesn't mean they
      actually know Him; they know all the answers to all the questions, all the
      parables, every beatitude, and a list of His miracles too.<br>
      <br>
      It is a great error to assume that since a child is born into a Christian
      family, he is a genuine follower of Christ. Many preacher parents are
      misled by the fact that their boy or girl had said the sinner’s prayer to
      them.<br>
      <br>
      Just like the moon, although they illuminate their environment, they do
      not have a source of light of their own. They only reflect the light they
      receive from the sun, which in this case, is their parent. The moment they
      move farther away from this source of light which they tend to reflect,
      the darker their light dims!<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUPER IMPOSED SALVATION</b><br>
      What the parents believe to be salvation is just an idea super imposed on
      his mind, nothing more, nothing less. His attitudes and actions may not
      betray any rebellion, but his present mindset is more of that of a star
      actor on a stage play, who only says what is needed to be said at the
      right time it has to be said, and does whatever action needs to be done at
      the time it is expected of him, while waiting for the period the episode
      will end. For such kids, that episode ends once they are free from the
      bondage of their preacher parents grip and are able to stand on their own,
      to decide which angle they want their lives to face.<br>
      <br>
      It is at this time that the rebellious spirit, though passive before now,
      becomes visible and more active. One discovers that there is no genuine
      love for God or true commitment to his works before now. He attends church
      services only when it is convenient for him, spends only the leftover of
      his money on church activities and is not so excited to talk openly about
      Christ or his commitment to him. This is Passive Rebellion, a sharp
      contrast from the person he was raised to become.<br>
      <br>
      Your son, unknown to you, may be doing all the right things expected of
      him at the right time and in the right way right in the church, but
      unknown to you may be doing them for the wrong reasons. He may just be a
      robot whose remote control lies in your hands, and what you call obedience
      may not be done for the love of Christ but as church or family
      obligations.<br>
      This prepackaged faith needs to be unpacked and repacked so as to ensure
      it is a genuine package. The process of reclaiming the faith as theirs
      always takes place once they get to the age of accountability when every
      Preacher’s Kid needs to move from believing in the faith of their parents
      to seeing faith as a personal relationship with God.<br>
      <br>
										</div>
										
										
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										<div style="text-align: justify;">
										This transmission from parental faith to personal faith, which for many
      often coincides with their teenage or youthful years, is not always
      without some struggles. It is at this stage most times, that they need
      their parents most, since it is this stage they begin to challenge most of
      what their parents believe in, not because they want to kick against it
      but because they need to take a more concrete decision about their
      relationship with God.<br>
      <br>
      These actions are what most Christian parents misjudge as rebellious, and
      so react sharply against them at the moment they need to be most
      understanding with them. This period, for some, may be filled with a
      number of minor crises between them and their parents, elders in the
      church and the church as a whole. For some others it could be a major
      battle, one that can last for several years.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Spiritually Coated Environment</b><br>
      This false assumption of the true status of their sons had made so many
      preacher parents let down their guards. The problem is not because the
      kids willingly choose to rebel, but because there was no deep roots,
      although their leaves sprung. For them, it is so easy to be deceived into
      believing they are believers since their natural habitat is tailor made to
      make them talk like, look like, and act like a believer all the time.
      This, which most Christian parents see as salvation, is a deceptive
      salvation.<br>
      <br>
      There is something comical about growing up in a highly spiritually
      sensitive environment that can make a Preacher’s Kid learn all the
      physical demonstrations and church manifestations of a spiritual person
      without having any iota of spirituality in him.<br>
      <br>
      The life of so many Pastors’ Kids is enough to conclude that it is
      possible to have so much scriptural knowledge and still be referred to as
      a spiritual mediocre when it comes to spiritual issues. With very minimal
      effort one is assumed to be a believer in good standing since one easily
      meets up with the church's expectation of who a believer is.<br>
      <br>
      The external spiritual appearance is not commensurate to the internal
      spiritual growth that is going on in them. He walks with a spiritual
      carriage, speaks all the spiritually-coated-languages and puts on dresses
      expected of a Christian Kid, but all he has is a form of godliness, and
      not a relationship with Christ. Although he is biblically versed and
      theologically sound, and had brought home many championship trophies by
      representing either his home church or his school at various Bible
      competitions, all he knows are just head knowledge of some memorized
      verses and all of the popular (with few of the unpopular) Bible stories.<br>
      <br>
      Growing up in a Christian home should raise the spiritual stock value of a
      Christian teen, but if not well handled, it could bounce back to do
      exactly otherwise. Due to the spiritually coated environment in which they
      are raised, they tend to know so much about Christ but really do not know
      him personally. What most of them have gathered over the years are just
      biblical stories and theological information and until these are turned
      into personal convictions in their hearts that will help them desire a
      closer walk with God, it remains spiritually irrelevant to them, although
      it may be of great benefits academically.<br>

										<div style="text-align: justify;">
										 Often, the parental interest is not on a genuine daily Christ-like living
      but on an adopted spiritual lifestyle. With this kind of lifestyle, there
      is always a sharp divide between what we think they believe and what is
      going on in their minds. God’s word to them, in this case, are just
      abstract information and not concrete issues that can govern the life of a
      young man. To them Christianity is seen either as a family culture or a
      personal hobby, not anything more than that or close to a passionate
      relationship with the risen Lord.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TEST OF FAITH</b><br>
      This adopted faith really looks good on them and makes them look good, as
      long as they are within the confines of the spiritually coated
      environment. The challenge becomes obvious when these kids are presented
      with the opportunity to leave these sanitized settings and mingle together
      with the real world.<br>
      <br>
      Almost everything in a pastor’s house helps you to appear spiritual even
      if you are not. The videos, the musicals, the magazines, the wall
      paintings, even the television channels you watch, the discussions
      allowed, up to the drink on the table at dinners times all makes you
      portray a form of godliness, despite denying the power in it.<br>
      <br>
      To make matters worse, most of them even go to Christian schools all of
      their days. The resistance to faith that comes from the environmental
      forces which is needed to make their faith stronger in Christ is not
      there. Until they find themselves in an atmosphere where they are allowed
      to do otherwise without being punished for it, their true nature which is
      enveloped by the spiritual coating is never exposed.<br>
      <br>
      With this kind of lifestyle, it is so easy to fall away from a close and
      intimate relationship with Christ the moment one leaves home to another
      environment that is not as spiritually conditioned as the place one is
      coming from. Most times, getting admission into college and mixing with
      other students in an environment totally different from that which they
      grew up always give them the opportunity needed to discover if they are
      really believers or just actors and sad to say, only few of them come out
      as genuine believers; most of them are just environment-friendly
      believers.<br>
      There are some situations of life that forces ones true character to
      surface. The Pastor’s Kid is not allowed to experience these situations
      while still growing up in a controlled spiritually isolated environment
      until he escapes into the real world, unprepared to meet these challenges.
      These situations are designed to make them stronger, and drive them closer
      to the Lord, while deepening their roots in the faith. But most of them
      meet these situations when they are far away from the purged atmosphere
      created for them at the home front and there is hardly anyone around them
      to spoon feed them by purging this new environment for them and
      encouraging them to stand for the faith, as it is always done for them at
      home. They have never been allowed to deal with the reality. They have
      always lived their lives in an ideal environment, so rather than learn to
      depend and trust God, they only flourished in a spiritually saturated
      environment.<br>
      <br>
      For teenagers who are highly active and explorative, this spiritual
      seclusions, spiritual pampering, and co-dependency will only make some
      Christian Kids grow into weak and unhealthy believers who may be
      defenseless to spiritual threats whenever found in the midst of a hostile
      spiritual environment. They are spiritually spoon fed from childhood to
      adulthood, without being left alone at any time to prepare their own
      spiritual meals themselves while being monitored by the preacher parents.<br>
      They get accustomed to subcontracting their spiritual responsibilities to
      their own spiritual growth and maturity to higher powers, basically their
      parents or a close elder in the church. They have been so shielded away
      from the hostile world system that so many of them do not even know it
      exists and those who believes it does, do not really believe it is as
      strong as it is until they by chance have a direct encounter with the
      system with their weak home grown, untested faith developed in a
      spiritually pruned environment.<br>
      <br>
      Any simple opportunity to test the convictions of their beliefs, be it in
      form of trials, temptations or pressure from friends, most of them will
      easily fall flat on their face. The devil is fully aware of this but the
      church is not.<br>
      Religion, to them, is like a Life Support Program where everything needed
      for life and godliness is provided by the medical practitioners on duty
      (which in this case is their parent) in their safe and protected religious
      environment. They always think life will continue like this.<br>
      <br>
      Truly, while growing up in their early age, Christian kids needs to be
      protected from every dart this corrupt world system will hurl at them
      through the media, internet, entertainment, education and the likes, but
      as they grow up, our responsibility needs to change from just simply being
      overprotective to preparing them to face the challenges of their age. This
      is the only way to grow a spiritually sound Pastor’s Kid. Spiritual
      strength is never developed by constantly avoiding a face-off with the
      devil; it only produces a weak willed, coward believer who will easily get
      broken under any light-weight temptation or attack of the enemy. A tree in
      the forest is only as strong as the fiercest storm it has withstood and
      not the one it has been protected from. A genuine believer can only be as
      strong as the temptations he has overcome and not the one he has been
      shielded from. Hence the popular cliché; no pain, no gain.<br>
      <br>
      Another angle to it is that you have given to the world greater power than
      it really has, if you feel that the blood of Jesus cannot secure your
      child if he gets in contact with the system. If the blood of Jesus will
      not secure a child’s destiny, how much can a preacher parent do?<br>
      <br>
      For those who succeeds in growing up in this circuit, alienated from the
      world since their birth, these kids grow up to have nothing to do with the
      world, either to minister to its lost souls or to bring them back to the
      Lord. This is the reason we have today so many adult believers whose
      parents are at the forefront of the kingdom business, but themselves today
      are just nominal believers who achieves little or nothing for the kingdom.
      All they feel they owe God and His church is just their regular attendance
      in church; nothing more, nothing less!<br>
      <br>
      Jesus could have protected the disciples from experiencing the storm in
      the sea, but as much as he would have loved to, he knew he would not be
      helping them by shielding them completely away from these experiences. So,
      on one occasion, he pretended to be sleeping in the boat in order to see
      how they would handle the situation. Seeing the best they could offer,
      given the present circumstance while he was still with them, he rebuked
      them. On another occasion, Jesus encouraged Peter to walk on the sea. All
      of these experiences cumulatively built the faith of the disciples who
      today are now referred to as the apostles. Some preacher parents also need
      to pretend they are sleeping once in a while so as to watch how their
      grown up kids will handle some situations in their life and not wait until
      they meet the situation unmonitored. Some needs to leave them alone for a
      while, and like Jesus, watch from afar to see if their bold-mouthed Peter
      can walk on sea unaided by the master (their parents) without sinking.<br>
      <br>
      <b>THE WAY OUT</b><br>
      This is not to encourage us to recklessly expose our kids to the corrupt
      world system without placing any guard at all. This will be unreasonable,
      as one big blow from the devil may crush an innocent tender heart. But the
      problem is being overprotective. As much as we need to pay very close
      attention to what our children needs to contend with, we also need to
      coach them on how to deal with these issues themselves, using the word of
      the Lord. This makes us their coach who trains them how to walk in the way
      to go, and this is far better than being their baby sitter who carries
      them every inch of the way, all day long.<br>
      <br>
      If our desire as parents is to keep them spiritually safe, we will succeed
      with ease in keeping them safe for a long time, but we will also
      unconsciously succeed in keeping them spiritually feeble. Spiritual
      muscles are developed in the same way physical muscles are, by exerting
      the muscles from time to time, otherwise, what you get is just spiritual
      fatness rather than strong spiritual muscles. A child fed with all the
      balanced diet in the world may look healthy from afar, but he can’t
      withstand in the boxing ring his mate who in addition with the balanced
      diet has built his muscles through constant trainings.<br>

										 Rather than bother your heads with how much of the world system gets to
      your kids, be more concerned about how much of it gets into them. This
      indeed is how to raise an effective Christian kid. Otherwise, they will
      find it difficult to overcome any external threat to their faith once they
      are alone. Kids raised contrary to this will only remain safe for as long
      as their Christian parents can replicate the exact safe haven they have at
      home in each and everywhere they go. Once these protective covering is
      tampered with, and their faith is exposed to the harsh realities of system
      of the world which they have not been trained to handle on their own, they
      are likely to fall like a pack of cards before the wind.<br>
      <br>
      The continuous development of the fruit of the Spirit in the life of a
      growing Christian child is ensured each time the child faces a temptation
      to express the exact opposite quality of the particular character of the
      fruit of the Spirit and he overcomes the temptation. If these
      opportunities, which most times comes as temptations are not available,
      one may be deceived that his teenage son really exhibits all the
      manifestations of the fruit of the spirit, until he is shocked to find out
      he has been deceived.<br>
      The truth be told, either in the physical or spiritual, there is no safety
      in enslaved freedom. Real safety is only guaranteed if one can defend this
      freedom any day, anytime, anywhere. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Last Note:</b><br>
      All the complaints and challenges mentioned herein may not be seen as a
      general representation of all of the experiences of all Preachers Kids.
      Each has its peculiarity. But the truth still remains, that every P.K.
      will be able to relate with, if not all, at least a larger part of these
      challenges.
