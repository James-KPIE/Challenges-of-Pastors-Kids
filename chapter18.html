										<h2>PART FIVE</h2>
    <h2>WHEN THE OFFSPRING OF A GODLY MAN BECOMES A SINFUL MAN</h2>
    <h2>Chapter Eighteen</h2>
    <h2>WHEN PREACHER’S KIDS BECOME WAYWARD</h2>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">It is possible for the offspring of a
      godly man to become a sinful man. Testimonies, though not too encouraging,
      abound of adults who were once brought up in a God fearing families and
      who today are no longer comfortable being around the same church
      environment where they cut their teeth as a kid.<br>
      <br>
      The Bible describes children as arrows in the hand of a mighty man. In the
      physical, the distance an arrow covers when it is thrown, the direction it
      travels when thrown, and the impact it has on what it is thrown at, all
      depends on the force and energy with which it is thrown by the mighty.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      This implies that, the seriousness with which a Preacher’s Kid will take
      the issues of Christianity, how grounded he will be in the faith, and how
      long he will stick to the same, all depends on whoever has brought him up
      in the same, be it the pastor and his spouse themselves, or whoever he has
      consciously or unconsciously delegated the responsibility.<br>
      <br>
      The Pastors’ family is God’s major tool for shaping Pastor’s Kids and for
      passing the faith on to them, no other organization or institution can do
      it better. Whatever effort they add, it can only complement the initial
      major contributions from the Preacher’s Kid’s nuclear family, and not
      substitute it. External influence, positive or negative, only becomes
      their major casting mold when the necessary foundational trainings are
      lacking at the home front.<br>
      <br>
      The quality of godly parenting a Preacher’s Kid receives at the home
      front, especially at the initial stage of his life influences every other
      thing later on in his life. It serves as a springboard that launches them
      into the future God has designed for them.<br>
      <br>
      No amount of good academic education can easily erase the impact of poor
      parenting on a Preacher’s Kid. The pastor who delegates the impartation of
      primary fundamental principles of his children solely to his church
      council, members or relatives, without major inputs from himself, is doing
      himself and the child a great disfavor, one which both of them may live to
      regret in the future if care is not taken.<br>
      <br>
      Sincerely, every pastor wants to be a good father, but the truth is,
      sometimes most of them really do not know that they haven’t been a good
      one, they feel they have been at their best so far, but their best does
      not measure up.<br>
      <br>
      There are challenges that are common to all parents, preacher or not. In
      addition to this, there are some other unique challenges that are peculiar
      to parents who have a special calling into particular aspects of the
      ministry. Some preacher parents do well in one, meeting up with the
      challenge but fail in the other. They find it difficult to combine
      parenting with ministry. Worse still, some other pastor fail in both, and
      their excuse for this failure is still the ministry.<br>
      <br>
      Raising godly children is an increasingly uphill task for any parent in
      this generation. It takes time, energy, money and prayers. So many
      Christian Kids have gone into drugs, addictions, early pregnancies,
      crimes, and the likes. This is really sad and heartbreaking. Any Christian
      parent will be devastated if one of their children turns away from the
      family faith, talk less of a preacher parent. This situation is not
      limited to Preacher’s Kids alone, but also children of most church
      professionals and church leaders. The experience becomes worse for pastors
      because he is a popular figure and he is expected to train his kids in the
      way of the Lord so as to prove to other parents in the church that he can
      train theirs too in the same way.<br>
    </div>
    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">BIBLICAL EXAMPLES OF WAYWARD PREACHERS’
      KIDS</h2>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">Although it is not always a sweet pill to
      swallow for any parent, the issue of children brought up in families that
      fear the Lord deciding on their own to stay in clear contrast to
      everything they have been taught while growing up, is not strange to the
      church. It started right from the first parent in the world, according to
      the Bible, and the first set of children that walked the surface of the
      earth.<br>
										</div>
										
										
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										<div style="text-align: justify;">
										Adam and Eve, can be said to be God fearing to an extent, save the
      singular mistake they made by disobeying God once, and which one of us
      today can claim to be better than them when it comes to obeying God’s
      instructions to the letter on daily basis. Despite their desire to live a
      godly life, one of their children, Cain, decided to choose a rebellious
      path which brought grief and anguish to his parents and untimely death to
      his brother.<br><br>
      This happened in an age when there was no social media, audiovisuals or
      peer pressure to influence his waywardness or encourage his rebellion,
      proving that a child's rebellion, to some extent, is always in the nature,
      and not always about the parents, although the parent’s lifestyle can, to
      a large extent, either fertilize it or dampen it. This singular action
      enthrones Cain as the first grandfather of all Christian kids who rebels.
      Aside Cain, there are numerous other preacher’s Kids in the Bible who
      chose to live a life of ungodliness and iniquity.<br>
      <br>
      Eli was the high priest over the house of Israel, an office similar to the
      position of the General Overseer of the largest church in a great country
      today. As close to God as he was, the Bible had practically nothing good
      to write about any of his two sons. His life ended on a bad note due to
      his children’s lifestyle. (1 Sam 2:12, 17)<br>
      <br>
      Prophet Samuel whom God found as a worthy replacement to the lineage of
      Eli after the demise of himself and his two sons also grew to be very
      great in the land. In fact, of him it was written that none of his word
      ever fell to the ground. One would have thought he would be able to guard
      his home properly and train his children in the way of the Lord, knowing
      the circumstance that brought him into the office he occupied presently.
      But alas, his children also did not fare better than the sons of his
      predecessor. They did so badly that the people did not wait for God to
      take their lives like He did Eli’s sons; they practically protested and
      revolted against their leadership, insisting that their aged father find
      them a replacement before his demise. (1 Sam 8:1-6)<br>
      <br>
      King David was addressed as a man after God’s heart, but he seemed to have
      more rebellious children than any other person in the whole of the Bible.
      Of his lineage came the record breaking story of the first incest in the
      Bible; Amnon who cunningly deceived and slept with Tamar, his blood
      sister. He also happened to be the only king that was upturned by his son.
      Absalom attempted a coup de tat against his father before nemesis caught
      up with him and King David reclaimed his throne. The young man even had
      the audacity to sleep with his father’s concubines on the roof top,
      defiling his father’s sacred bed publicly. Towards the end of his life,
      his oldest surviving son, Adonijah, also declared himself king over the
      house of Israel without his father’s consent. If not for the timely
      intervention of Nathan the prophet, the plan for of God for Solomon would
      have been thwarted. King David seemed to have so many of them.<br>
      <br>
      Of note in the New Testament is the story of the prodigal son who had
      every good thing that life could bestow on a growing teenager, but yet
      decided he is not comfortable with how fair life has been to him. He
      plundered his father and went in search of greener pastures, exploring the
      vain pleasures the surrounding cities presented to him. He came back
      humbly and regretfully, drained of every good thing he left with.<br>
      <br>
      From the foregoing, since most of the active rebels are males, one may be
      tempted to think that male children are likely to revolt much more than
      the females. Pastor’s Kids rebellion has nothing to do with the gender of
      the child in question. Before now, one can safely conclude that more of
      masculine Pastor’s Kids easily rebel than the feminine, but in this new
      age and amidst this tumultuous generation when masculine or feminine
      Pastors’ Kids rebellion has taken a huge turn, each gender tries
      effortlessly to outdo the other in rebelling against the Church of their
      father.<br>
      <br>
      One major female who, in a sense, could be said to live a wayward life in
      the Bible is Dinah, the only daughter of Jacob. She was not just the
      daughter of Leah and Jacob, but she also was the granddaughter of Isaac
      and great granddaughter of Abraham, the father of faith. She came from
      such a long list of god-fearing patriarchs. In addition to this, she was
      overly protected by eleven blood brothers. At her age, although she was
      physically mature enough to draw the attention of men, and in this case, a
      prince of the land, but she was silly enough, for curiosity sake, to leave
      the comfort of her father’s camp and her brothers’ protective eyes to go
      visit the girls of the land unaccompanied. She ended up being raped by a
      total stranger. She was the first of the children of Jacob to be given a
      major narrative attention in the Bible; a whole chapter is devoted to this
      incident, but it is not a very palatable one. Not much is heard of her
      after this.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      What a wasted life! Her major fault was that she was at the wrong place at
      the wrong time, with the wrong association! She ended up being treated the
      wrong way.<br>
    </div>
    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">MINISTERING TO YOUR CHILDREN</h2>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">It is a great mistake to assume that being
      parented by a person who makes his living by spreading the gospel message
      should guarantee the followership of the message by the Preacher’s Kid.
      Having a minister of the gospel as a father does not automatically
      transfer upon a Preacher’s Kid the right to naturally become a child of
      God when they come of age; enough experiences abound to support this.
      Someone needs to take every Pastor’s Kid through the journey that leads to
      the foot of the cross where everyone must have a personal encounter with
      the Lord Jesus and the saving grace in his name.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, everyone is always quick to assume that every Preacher’s
      Kid is a strong believer from his mother’s womb. This negates the
      confession of the Psalmist, “Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin
      did my mother conceive me”. Psa_51:5 Even some Pastor’s Kids too, who have
      not yet at any time in their lives consciously giving their lives to
      Jesus, are deceived into believing they are one.<br>
      <br>
      This is why most Pastors’ Kids hate being asked how long they have been
      saved. They have always been! They have always been in church and so have
      always been saved. They do not know the difference. They were brought up
      in church all of their lives, and have heard all of the sermons anyone
      could preach, and to them, that should be equal to being saved. The truth
      is, until they consciously confess Jesus as their Lord and Savior,
      inviting Him to take control of their hearts, they are not yet saved,
      irrespective of how many years they have been in the church. That if thou
      shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine
      heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For
      with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth
      confession is made unto salvation. Rom 10:9-10<br>
      <br>
      Someone has to lead them to make this decision for Christ, and it will be
      very good if God finds their preacher father or his spouse a worthy
      instrument to perform this task. Although it makes no difference if
      someone else outside the pastors family is used for the glorious
      assignment. It will in no way reduce the joy in heaven over this sinner
      that repents.<br>
      <br>
      As important as this decision is, it is neither done at the pastor’s own
      time or by force. It is only done when the Holy Spirit, the only One who
      convicts men of sin, has perfected the work of their salvation, and not
      before then, no matter how early their preacher parents really desire that
      this is done.<br>
										</div>
										
											
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="messages">
										<div style="text-align: justify;">
										 When it comes to a Preacher’s Kid’s salvation experience, aside taking the
      place of the Holy Spirit to get him converted right away, there is so much
      the pastor can do. Before the task of salvation is ultimately accomplished
      by God and the son’s heart is made ready to cooperate with His spirit to
      do His will, the pastor’s major task as a father is to keep being not just
      a pastor to them, but a father, teaching them the word of the Lord,
      raising them in the way of the Lord, and praying regularly for them. But
      most pastors always neglect what men can do, and clamor to do what men
      cannot do which is specially reserved for the Holy Spirit to accomplish,
      and that is the reason for all the frustrations most pastors go through in
      trying to raise a spirit-led, born-again Preacher’s Kid.<br>
      <br>
      If things are not done the way they should be done, men of God will
      discover almost too late that it is possible to raise a very good
      Preacher’s Kid who is not a Christian at all. All it takes to be a good
      Preacher’s Kid is to meet people’s expectations about you. But all it
      takes to be a Christian is to give your life to Jesus and live a life
      pleasing unto Him.<br>
      Since most Pastors’ Kids are born into great Christian families, and have
      always heard the altar call from their childhood, Christianity, purely as
      a religion, has already become a part of them, but the truth is that some
      of them have not intentionally accepted Christ into their lives at any
      point in their lives. When questioned about why they do what they do, most
      Pastors’ Kids have no thoughtful response to give, if they have any at
      all.<br>
      Christianity, as a religion, only indoctrinates one, brainwashing through
      a set of do’s and don’ts. It is always very easy to indoctrinate a
      Preacher’s Kid before the age of reasoning. Once they come of age,
      indoctrination no longer works. You need to make them see reasons with you
      before they can dance to your tunes.<br>
      <br>
      Once they come of age, they start to reconsider those claims you have made
      them believed in their early days, demanding concrete evidences to support
      those assertions. These questioning are not an attack on your faith. They
      really are to help them take a final decision on what you have made them
      believe. This is the time to sit them down and explain to them the
      rudiments of salvation, letting them know why you believe what you
      believe, and why you do what you do. However, at such times, most preacher
      parents see it more as a direct assault on their beliefs and so react in a
      way that will make such kids withdraw further away from the faith.<br>
      <br>
      Every preacher parent needs to know that questioning the things they
      believe in is an integral part of spiritual maturation for any teen or
      youths, especially a Pastor’s Kid and willhelp him become a better and
      stronger believer who can defend the cause and the faith of his parents.<br>
    </div>
    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">A WORD OF ADVICE TO THE PREACHER PARENT</h2>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">As much as you are bothered about the
      spiritual health of your members, you should be more bothered about the
      spiritual health of your children. You may not be able to save your
      children, but you can nurture them and safeguard them from outside
      influences that can make them revolt against the church in the future.<br>
      <br>
      Your desire should not just be to raise kids who will not discredit your
      ministry or disgrace you among your members but to raise kids that will
      know, love and honor the Lord. It is not enough that they can quote
      scriptures off hand, lead prayers in church, assist in the choir
      department, or just sit down as a saint when service is going on. You must
      do all possible to ensure that they have a relationship with the God of
      their father.<br>
      <br>
      The eyes of men may be watching, but the eyes of the Lord are more
      important. Let them know that it is better to be a good follower of Christ
      than to be a good Preacher’s Kid. They do not have to be taught to act in
      a particular way because their parents are preachers. Teach them to behave
      well in church and everywhere they find themselves, not just because of
      who their parents are (pastors), but because of who they are (Christians).
      Let them love the things of God, not because they are related to a pastor
      but because they have a connection with the risen Lord.<br>
      Beyond whatever experience and expertise a pastor may claim to have, every
      time a Preacher’s Kid needs help, the pastor needs grace to minister to
      him. Most ministers take this for granted. They seem to only approach the
      issues depending on what they know, or on how they have dealt with similar
      issues in the lives of the sons and daughters of other members. They
      forget that in this particular case, they are not just the consultants
      invited to verbally proffer solutions, but that they are the main client,
      who needs to carry out the suggested solutions themselves in order to see
      the desired results.<br>

                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="settings">
										<div style="text-align: justify;">
										Do not forget, it is naturally difficult for the unregenerated mind to
      always do what is pleasing to the Lord, even if he is an adult in the
      church. It is therefore not too reasonable to expect the Preacher’s Kid
      who is not yet regenerated to always live a life that is pleasing unto the
      Lord every time. If we force them to, we will teach them to live a life of
      hypocrisy and pretense.<br>
      <br>
      Face the fact; although your children may differ in so many ways to a
      non-preacher’s kid, especially in the moral trainings and the spiritual
      upbringings they get both at home and in the church, but when it comes to
      the tendency to want to sin and affinity to the world, they are as normal
      as every other kid. This is a disturbing truth which many preacher-parents
      do not want to admit!<br>
      <br>
      Understand that being a Preacher’s Kid does not make them different from
      any other kids in your church or community. They have the same bodily
      composition like others which has the propensity to want to respond or
      yield to sin when tempted. What makes the difference is the grace of God
      that helps one to stand in the midst of these challenges of life. This
      grace is obtainable by constant nurturing in the word and offering
      relentless prayers for them, and not through yelling and shouting.<br>
      <br>
      No amount of Bible study, family worship, or child psychology will shelter
      them from Satan's attacks if they personally choose to be trapped in the
      snare of the devil. It can be very heart breaking to the parent if they
      choose to thread this part; but when they do, love them more than ever
      before and pray harder for them<br>
      <br>
      Do not allow your wayward child to become a distraction to you in
      ministry. If care is not taken, because of this new challenge created by
      your child who does not want to follow in the path of righteousness, you
      may be distracted from your core area of ministry, beingburdened by the
      thought of him. This may become double loss for you. Paul may plant truly,
      and Apollos water, but only God can bring the increase. Face your
      ministry, while not neglecting your child in prayers and supplications.
      But do not let him become the excuse why your ministry will experience a
      setback, especially if you are sure you have actually done your own part.<br>
      <br>
      Remember, each person will stand before God to give account of his
      activities on earth on the last day. You will not be responsible for the
      consequences of his choice, if you are sure you have satisfied your
      conscience in training him up in the way of the Lord.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FREEWILL</b><br>
      God has given everyone a level of free will to make choices that he thinks
      are best for him in life. Even in heaven, one of the sons of God rebelled
      against God’s ways and influenced a third of the angels in heaven to do
      the same.<br>
      <br>
      Whichever way you see it, and whether you believe it or not, every
      individual have his personal responsibility to God and must make his
      personal choice to either follow Christ or not, be it a Preacher’s Kid or
      not. However, one may have the free will to make a choice between Christ
      and evil, but one will not have the freewill to pick the consequences of
      his choice. His choice naturally attracts its own consequences.<br>
      Parents generally, preacher or not, are only supposed to help and guide
      their wards to make it easy for them to make the decision for Christ when
      the time is ripe and not to force it on them (the decision cannot be
      forced on anyone anyway). Once we can get this right as preacher parents,
      it becomes easy for us to relate with the Preacher’s Kids and help them
      convincingly.<br>
      <br>
      If we hope to force this decision on them, then we no longer see them as
      humans that have self-will; we only see them as robots that can be turned
      on and of whenever we desire. So, your responsibility is to make it easy
      for them to make such decision at the appropriate time in their life, and
      that appropriate time may be influenced by you, but it is solely
      determined by the Holy Spirit.<br>
      <br>
      No matter how easy you make the decision look to them, it still may not be
      done until the right time when they are really ready for it. That ‘right
      time’ may come earlier than you will appreciate it, or later than you will
      envisage it. It poses no problem if it comes earlier in their life.
      However, it becomes a great issue to the pastor if it begins to take
      longer than he expected to get them to decide for Christ and follow the
      faith of their father.<br>
      <br>
      Every pastor knows this of a certainty, that no one has any powers to make
      anyone a Christian, other than interceding for them. But when it comes to
      dealing with their own children, they want to exercise these powers they
      are not given. No singular person has been bestowed this divine privilege;
      it is God’s sole responsibility.<br>
      <br>
      Let their decision to become a Christian come out of their need to receive
      Christ into their life as their savior and do not just pressure them
      unnecessarily to do so simply because they are Preacher’s Kid. If you
      force them to take the decision in your presence simply because they are
      Preacher’s Kid they will willingly reverse the decisions when they are no
      longer under your roof. But if you make them see reasons and they
      willingly receive the God of the calling of their father into
      their lives, it will be practically difficult for anything on
      earth to force them to reverse the decision.
