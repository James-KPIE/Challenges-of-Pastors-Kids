    <h2>HANDLING DIFFICULT MEMBERS</h2>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><i><code><b>What Every Pastor’s Kid Owe The
            Church Members<br>
            <br>
          </b></code></i></div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">If you have not seen the worst of
      church members before, then you have not been a Preacher’s Kid for too
      long. The meanest of people hide in the church. It can blow your mind the
      things that people can say and do. So you must learn how to deal with
      them.<br>
      <br>
      Every Preacher’s Kid knows that there are some members in your parent’s
      church who are very difficult to please. No matter what you do, you still
      end up having clashes with them. Most times, they are not just guests or
      visiting members, they are long standing members (either in good standing
      or not does not really matter) whom other members really<br>
      admire. Most of these are troublesome members, because all they do is to
      cause trouble for the Pastor’s Kids.<br>
      <br>
      As a P.K, you have to get used to the excesses of your father’s
      congregation; bad as they may be, they are your father’s greatest asset in
      ministry. Although with them, there are likely to be some problems and
      challenges, but without them, there is really no ministry, all your father
      will have is just an empty church hall.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Do Not Take It Out On God</b><br>
      All pastors’ kids are encouraged not to consider walking away from
      Christianity as a choice. Do not let what trusted church members do to you
      cause you to run away from God. Rather let it move you closer to God.
      Whatever happens, hold the forth. When a Preacher’s Kid walks away from
      the faith, it is a poor testimony to the truth of Christianity. You may
      feel deeply hurt by the way church members have treated your parents, but
      it is not enough reasons to turn your back on God<br>
      .<br>
										</div>
										
										
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										<div style="text-align: justify;">
										It is not God who hurts you, it is the members. So why take it out on God!
      If there is anyone who can help you from getting over these hurts more
      than any other person, it is God, and keeping away from him will not do
      you any good. You need to get your mindset/argument right. This will help
      to put your case in a proper light and to reason straight. Who is this
      your rebellion actually directed to? Is it towards God, your parents, or
      the church authority?<br>
      <br>
      If the problem you have is with the church authority, you may consider a
      change of church denomination as long as you can convince your parents
      that it will bring an end to whatever shortcomings they complain about. It
      is safer for them to have you as an established Christian youth in another
      denomination than to have you as a rebellious believer in their own
      denomination.<br>
      <br>
      This decision may not be very easy for them to accept, especially if you
      still stay under the same roof with them but with prayers and constant
      encouragements God will minister to their hearts. However, you will need
      to let them see what the exact issues you have with their church authority
      is, whether it is with a personality or doctrines and also assure them
      that the new denomination you are crossing over to is Bible based with
      sound scriptural principles and not just a hip hop club house with the
      signboard of a church of God. A whole chapter is devoted to this later on
      in this book.<br>
      <br>
      If the problem is with your parents, in respect of the way they treat you
      whenever they are around their church members, you may need to sit them
      down and talk things over with them. Put sentiments aside and discuss
      practical issues you feel are affecting your relationship with God because
      of them. Let them see these things from your point of view; they may be
      things they have never thought of before now and discussing with them may
      just open their eyes to it. After such discussion, if it is not beyond
      their powers, they may decide to turn a new leaf.<br>
      <br>
      Even if they do not, you should decide to serve God to the best of your
      ability irrespective of who is trying to be a stumbling block to you. No
      man should allow another, no matter how close he is to him, to become a
      stumbling block to him in this spiritual journey. All you owe them is to
      let them know how you feel about their actions, especially those which are
      against the scriptures. It is not your part to force them to change; leave
      that to the Holy Spirit to do. Only ensure that their lifestyle does not
      become the reason why you end up in hell.<br>
      <br>
      If your problem is with God, you may need a counselor to confide in, and
      in this case the counselor need not be your preacher parents so as to
      allow you some level of freedom to actually divulge your grievances with
      God without being looked down upon as a rebelling Preacher’s Kid. Whatever
      the issues you have with God, frustrations you have with<br>
      Christianity, and anger you have against the Holy Spirit, a good counselor
      can always reason with you and explain to you the things you need to know
      so that you can reconnect yourself back to God.<br>

										<div style="text-align: justify;">
										<b>Be Closer To God</b><br>
      Rather than focus on members of the church who constantly make you unhappy
      and disinterested in the gospel service, you will do well to work more on
      your relationship with God. This is not just about pleasing members of
      your parents’ church, or being in the church council’s good record. You
      can be in their good record and still have an unpleasant relationship with
      your creator. But there is no way you can be in God’s good book and still
      have any serious challenge with men who truly speaks on behalf of God.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Avoid Hypocrites</b><br>
      Learn to spot the hypocrites in the audience and avoid them. So many
      people are just men pleasers. They place much more burden on you than they
      can bare themselves. Some of them just intentionally want to bully the
      Preacher’s Kid to gain a position of authority over them so as to control
      them. Learn to identify them and carefully give them some space.
      Cautiously minimize your contacts with them, and when it is unavoidable
      that you meet them, handle them wisely.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Do Not Be Rude</b><br>
      Do not be discourteous or ill-mannered when dealing with them; two wrongs
      do not make a right. Be nice to every person in the congregation, even if
      they are rude to you! Do not forget that you are supposed to act like an
      angel because you are the Pastor’s Kid, and even if you are mistakenly
      slapped on the right cheek, you must be ready to turn the other cheek.
      Therefore, do not wait until you are given the first slap, you may not
      have the comportment to turn the other one. Whenever someone is rude to
      you, you must respond in a polite way because you are not allowed to react
      the way you want to.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Be Willing To Forgive</b><br>
      The people who have hurt you may not even know that they have. Some of
      them may have even done whatever they did with honest intentions without
      knowing that they have stepped on your toes. Keeping malice with them
      without letting them know what they have done wrong will make you act in
      an unchristian way. So, stand up to the one who hurts you and politely let
      him see what he has done wrong. Then, whether he apologizes or not,
      forgive him and forget about the offence. Do not let their actions create
      an unforgiving spirit in you and cause you to spend your eternity where
      you have not planned to.<br>
										</div>
										
											
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="settings">
										<div style="text-align: justify;">
										There are those who intentionally make life difficult for you for no just
      cause, be willing to forgive them too. Some members can be so cruel,
      insensitive, deceptive and evil, still, forgive them! Forgive those who
      have made your life so hard. This is the whole essence of Christianity.
      God forgave us and allowed His Son to shed his blood for the remission of
      our sins while we were yet sinners, and we also should be willing to
      forgive those who trespass against us, without them asking for our
      forgiveness.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Respect All</b><br>
      Respect all those who are older than you, whether they are in your
      preacher parent’s good book or not. What matters is that they are older
      than you, and they deserve some respect. Let your parents settle their
      scores with whomever; do not get entangled in battles you do not know its
      source. You are just the preacher’s kid, and not his barrister.<br>
      <br>
      One way to show you respect all is by courteously greeting every member of
      the church that passes by you. This may indeed not be the true test of
      your respect for the person, but it can, on the surfa
