										<h1>PART ONE - The Pastor's Kid</h1>
										<h2>Chapter Two - BLESSINGS OF BEING A PREACHER’S KID</h2>
										<p align="justify">The title of this book, Challenges of Being A Preacher’s Kid, may make one jump to a quick but inadequate conclusion that the life of an average Preacher’s Kid is only filled with challenges. This is not true. There are so many blessings that are attached to being a Preacher’s Kid, and before we start to talk about the challenges, it will soothe a lot of minds if we run over the blessings in this chapter.</p>
										<p align="justify">Being a Preacher’s Kid will give you some very unusual opportunities and privileges which most of your age mates may not have direct access to, and may become envious of you for! Your P’.K. status does not mean your life is going to be all gloomy and sad, not when you have some or all of these divinely provided remunerations. These opportunities are part of the paybacks of being a Preacher’s Kid, and any Preacher’s Kid will honestly tell you that, if it is only for these remunerations, it is a great thing to be a Preacher’s Kid.</p>
										<p align="justify">Rather than keep complaining about the few pressures and challenges they face, every Preacher’s Kid needs to be grateful to God for these benefits the more. If only they will focus more on these compensations and less on the associated unpalatable encounters, their lives as Preacher’s Kids will reflect more of gratitude to God than of complaints about the challenges and the inhumane treatments. Some of these benefits are discussed in this chapter.</p>

                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										<ol>
											<li><b>Leadership And Administrative Skills</b></li>
												<p align="justify">As a Preacher’s Kid, life presents you with a highly coveted opportunity to develop leadership and administrative skills at a very tender age of your life. Your constant participation, actively or passively in the smooth running of the church from your early age will help you to involuntarily develop great leadership skills. You get to church early, you close late, and you notice everything that happens in between those times.</p>
												<p align="justify">These early exposures to the things some of your mates may never get to know about until later years will sharpen your organizational and directorial skills. You have the opportunity to watch closely the leadership styles of your father and that of other leaders in the church, and unconsciously take side with which you prefer. You see them critically assess the options available to them before taking decisions, and you are also there to see the results of the decisions taken, whether it justifies the decision making process or not.</p>
												<p align="justify">All of these serve as passive training sessions which unconsciously add tremendous value to your life. Some of these skills will be very useful to you in the nearest future, whether you end up in the ministry or not.</p>
											<li><b>Development Of Communication Skill</b></li>
												<p align="justify">If you are scared of public speaking, all you need do is become a Preacher’s Kid for a while, and you will no longer entertain such fears again. Preacher’s Kids from birth are unconsciously trained to face the crowd boldly, and it grows with them into adulthood.</p>
												<p align="justify">From most of the opportunity life presents to them, they learn how to stand before a group of people and communicate intelligently. Both publicly and privately, while growing up, they are mandated to teach, counsel, exhort and answer questions related to either the Bible or its applications in everyday life. These help them to develop great communication skill.</p>
												<p align="justify">Aside learning to face the multitudes, they also get called upon to give unscheduled impromptu speeches from time to time. This increases their ability to reason on their feet and still come up with sensible speeches. All these are great skills that even most adults desire to have so as to boost their economic worth. They are all readily learnt as a Preacher’s Kid without having to go to a Bible School or a Communication School. What a privilege!</p>
											<li><b>Unusual Open Doors</b></li>
												<p align="justify">If your father is a good man in your community, (and most genuine pastors are anyway), his name can perform wonders for you. Merely knowing that you are the son of the pastor of the church down the road can open doors for you that your mates have been struggling to open for months!</p>
												<p align="justify">The ‘man-know-man’ thing works everywhere, even in religious circles, just that it is given a more spiritual appellation; it is called ‘divine connection’ among believers. Your father’s influence in the community, or on the people in the church whom he has impacted their lives positively in times past, will work for you. These people see your life as a golden opportunity to return the kind gestures of your father. So, you find yourself enjoying favors that you really do not deserve, and you find doors you have not knocked opening for you.</p>
												<p align="justify">This will keep happening almost everywhere you go to. It will help you when processing your admission into higher institutions or when seeking employment in some big hard-to-get organizations. You just find yourself moving ahead easily in life with little or no stress, compared to your mates who, at times have better qualifications. It is one of the Value-Added-Benefits of being a Preacher’s Kid.</p>
											<li><b>Freebies</b></li>
												<p align="justify">You also enjoy the privilege of knowing and having a direct one-on-one relationship with the ‘who-is-who’ in your father’s church and in the community as a whole. The pleasure in knowing them does not only come from, or stop at knowing them alone, things will naturally flow from their life to yours, not because of anything you have done, but just because you are the Preacher’s Kid.</p>
												<p align="justify">When the important personalities in the church and the ‘Big Boys’ in the community come to church for counseling, or when they come to visit the Pastor’s family, they do not come empty handed. Whenever they are ready to leave, the Preacher’s Kid is made to smile. If you are really a Preacher’s Kid, you will understand the reason for these smiles; nice little gifts!</p>
												<p align="justify">While growing up, it could be something as small as sweets, biscuits, cookies, candies, and little coins, and as you grow up, it gets better with stuffs like clothing, cell phones, recharge cards, gadgets or even some cool cash. Most may not admit it, but sincerely while growing up, every Pastor’s Kid always look forward to these freebies, and may be very disappointed when it does not come from where they expect it. It is not as though they have come to see it more as their rights, but they just get used to it unconsciously.</p>
											<li><b>Improved Status</b></li>
												<p align="justify">Being a Preacher’s Kid will give you status, both in the church and in your school. It will earn you some honest respect from some people around you, some of whom may even be older than you and have achieved more things than you in life.</p>
												<p align="justify">This respect or the high status is not really given to the Pastor’s Kids, but the honor is that which is transferred from the pastor to his kids. As a Preacher’s Kid, it feels very nice earning such respect from people you do not expect it from and at times, you are so overwhelmed by such gestures, but beware, do not let it get into your head. You really do not deserve this elevated status. There is little you have done in life that could make you earn it. It is just a reflection of the people’s respect for your father. So, be grateful for it whenever it comes, and do not feel bad about it if it does not.</p>
												
											<li><b>Free Access</b></li>
												<p align="justify">One major benefit of being a Preacher’s Kid is that you have free access to everything within the church compound. It is as though everything within the circumference of the church property is owned by your father, and no one dares tries to barricade you from any of them.</p>
												<p align="justify">This free access will help you to develop a lot of latent abilities and potentials which you never knew you possessed. At a very early age, you get unchallenged access to the musical instruments, an opportunity that makes many Pastors’ Kids become very good at handling several musical instruments without attending any Musical School.</p>
												
											<li><b>Development Of Personal Dignity</b></li>
											<p align="justify">One of your responsibilities, as we will see later on in this book, is to help your father from time to time at his duty post as the Church Pastor. This may require a great sacrifice on your part, but it would also help you to develop a high level of self-esteem. This high self-esteem always gives one a good sense of dignity.</p>
												
											<li><b>Cheap Popularity</b></li>
											<p align="justify">As the Preacher’s Kid, you are one of the most popular persons in the church. Almost every person in church knows you, no matter how quiet you claim to be; anyone who does not know you is likely to be a ‘new comer’; The only person more popular than you in the whole church most likely are your parents!</p>
											<p align="justify">This is a plus to being a P.K. You share the limelight with your parents. This cheap popularity can bring you a whole lot of good if you manage it well, but it also has its own disadvantages.</p>

											<h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
											<p align="justify">
												Whichever of these benefits you are presently partaking of, always constantly remind yourself that this honor is not really reserved for you, it is reserved for the Preacher’s Kid, and for as long as you are going to remain in your calling as a Preacher’s Kid, living a life that is pleasing unto God and worthy of this calling, you will enjoy them the more. But if you choose to behave contrary to what heaven expects of such positions, the honor may be taken away from you without your consent. This is why every Pastor’s Kid needs to be very careful how they live their lives. <blockquote style="background-color:white">“And, Let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity”. 2 Tim 2:19</blockquote>

										<h2>Comments</h2>
										<p align="justify">The Challenges of Preacher’s Kid or as it is sweetly coined in the book ‘PK’ is a book that has brought to bear the many challenges faced in the dual roles of a Preacher and their children, giving the huge expectations placed on a Preacher’s kid, and some of the fallouts that have been experienced by some and also the many responsibilities placed on a Preacher’s kid.</p>
										<p align="justify">The book extensively dealt with the challenges faced by every child born in the homes of a Preacher/Pastor; the dual roles of being a child and also being a Preacher’s child, and that of being a Parent and also being the Pastor of your child. These roles are challenging and must be effectively carried out with wisdom and discernment by understanding the distinct roles and knowing when each of these roles must be carried out in effective parenting and pastoring.</p>
										<p align="justify">This book is a passionate expression of a concerned parent of Pastor’s Kids whose burden deserves to be shared. It is an uncommon book needed in the Church and society. The book although titled “CHALLENGES OF A PASTOR’S KID, does not emphasize the negatives about the status of Pastor’s children. It is a balanced approach to the realities affecting Pastor’s kids both in positive and negative sides.</p>
										<p align="justify">The author, Sam O. Salau, analyzed the numerous demands on Pastor’s kids without any specified training to qualify them for such demands. It is interesting to see the author confirming the call of God evident on Pastor’s kids through their parental “priesthood” and the beauty with blessings attached to it. By this, he encouraged the Pastor’s kids to value and protect the “priesthood” of their family.</p>
										<p align="justify">This book in its capacity commends the status of Pastor’s kids, corrects the errors of Pastor’s kids and recommends the roles of their parents, the church leaders and members to make them models and successors to the ministry of their parents.</p>
										<p align="justify">The author, Pastor Sam O. Salau is passionate about today and tomorrow of the Pastor’s Kids and the ministry of their Pastor parents. Those of like minds should purchase and circulate this book for the benefits of their Pastors and congregations. More than this, the book should be read, appropriated and applied.</p>

										<hr>
										Pastor Sam thanks a million for taking the challenge of writing a book on this sensitive aspect of life. Pastors are trained for ministry not their kids. This book is a 'school' for Pastors' Kids how I pray that the book will get to every pastor's home. The title reads CHALLENGES OF A PASTOR'S KIDS but it's a must read for every pastor as well. I will recommend this book to even church members as this will help them help the pastor and his family to fulfill ministry. Well done!</p>

										<p align="justify">It is a general knowledge that everyone expects so much from a Pastors’ child; they are not seen like the normal everyday child, rather they are seen as the perfect ones and expected to act like one. Sam. O. Salau has identified a whole lot of these challenges and has proffer solutions and also the best ways that would help anyone that is either a ‘PK’, or the Parents of a ‘PK’ to live out the fullness of what is expected of them by God.</p>
										<p align="justify">Sam. O. Salau has given a distinct analysis and broad knowledge of every individual that helps shape the lives of a ‘PK’. Challenges of Pastors’ Kids has been written in one of the most simplest forms to make reading interesting, lessons also learnt and applying the principles in the book easy to adapt.</p>
										<p align="justify">The in-depth of this book shows a lot of research was done. Everyone that has a relationship with a ‘PK’ would be doing a great help, building up, teachings and giving them the truth about their roles as a ‘PK’ when you make them read this book. This book has to be read by every Preacher/Pastor.</p>
										<p align="justify">Sam.O.Salau has done a wonderful work by writing this book and its certainly coming at the right time when our society needs it.</p>

										<hr>
										<p align="justify">Sam O. Salau has really put his hears on the ground to listen to the unconfessed challenges of the pastors' kids in all ramifications. He systematically proffers solutions both to the Pastors' Kids and their parents, including lay members. I recommend this book to all pastors' parents and their kids especially young singles going into the ministry.</p>

										<hr>
										<p align="justify">Finally we have a point of succor for the many challenges of the Pastor's kid. We thank God for the gift of Pastor Sam Salau and men like him who release their mind to conceive Divine Burden. This is a very rare but long-overdue piece that addresses a very peculiar subject. Some of us who have been Pastors' kids for over the quarter of a century cannot but strongly identify with this work. Still, for those of us who have chosen the path that our Fathers trod, it is all the more relevant. My reckoning is that this work is not only for the Pastor and his Kids, but also for everyone who has a Pastor and whose pastor has at least one kid.</p>
